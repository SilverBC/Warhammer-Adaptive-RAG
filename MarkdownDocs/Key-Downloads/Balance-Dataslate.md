# BALANCE DATASLATE JUNE 2024

However you choose to play Warhammer 40,000, the recommendations in this document are designed to create the most balanced and enjoyable experience for all players, taking into consideration the latest data and feedback from a wide variety of sources. They will be applied in full at all official Games Workshop matched play and Crusade events, and reviewed periodically. Where existing passages of rules text are presented, new or revised sections are marked in red. Entries marked with a new entry icon have been newly added or revised since the previous iteration of this document.

# CORE RULES

# Stratagems

Add the following:

# STRATAGEMS THAT CAN BE USED MORE THAN ONCE PER PHASE/TURN

Parts of a rule that allow a player to use a Stratagem even if they have already targeted another unit with that Stratagem in the same phase can only be used if the name of the Stratagem is specified in that rule. Similarly, if a Stratagem is limited to one use per player per turn (e.g. Fire Overwatch), per battle round or per battle, such parts of that rule can only be used if the name of the Stratagem is specified in that rule.

# MODIFYING A STRATAGEM’S CP COST

Rules that enable you to target a unit from your army with a Stratagem for 0CP, but that do not specify the name of the Stratagem (e.g. a Captain’s Rites of Battle ability), instead reduce the CP cost of that use of that Stratagem by 1CP.

If a model has a rule that would, once per battle, increase the CP cost of an opponent’s Stratagem (e.g. a Callidus Assassin’s Reign of Confusion ability), that rule is replaced with the following ability:

‘Lord of Deceit (Aura): Each time your opponent targets a unit from their army with a Stratagem, if that unit is within 12" of this model, increase the cost of that use of that Stratagem by 1CP.’

As this ability does not specify the name of the Stratagem, the part of this ability that modifies the CP cost of the Stratagem follows the ‘Modifying a Stratagem’s CP Cost’ rules (see above), and the part of this ability that would have let you use the same Stratagem more than once in the same phase cannot be used at all.

Together, these changes mean the effect of the Rites of Battle ability becomes: ‘Once per battle round, one unit from your army with this ability can use it when its unit is targeted with a Stratagem. If it does, reduce the CP cost of that use of that Stratagem by 1CP.’

# STRATAGEMS THAT PREVENT UNITS FROM BEING TARGETED

If a Stratagem has an effect that says the target unit ‘can only be selected as the target of a ranged attack if the attacking model is within 12"’, or ‘cannot be targeted by ranged attacks unless the attacking model is within 12"’ (e.g. Haloed in Soulfire), that effect is changed to say ‘can only be selected as the target of a ranged attack if the attacking model is within 18".’

Example: The effect of the Grey Knights Haloed in Soulfire Stratagem becomes: ‘Until the start of your next Movement phase, your unit can only be selected as the target of a ranged attack if the attacking model is within 18".’

# STRATAGEMS THAT ADD NEW UNITS TO YOUR ARMY

If a Stratagem has the effect of adding ‘a new unit to your army that is identical to your destroyed unit’ (e.g. Join the Hunt, Unending Waves, Reinforcements, etc.), add the following Restriction to that Stratagem:

‘RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this Stratagem once per battle.’# Warhammer 40K Faction Rules
