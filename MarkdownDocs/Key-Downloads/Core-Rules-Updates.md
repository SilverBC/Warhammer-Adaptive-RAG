# CORE RULES UPDATES VERSION 1.2

(WITH RULES COMMENTARY 1.4)

This document collects amendments to the Warhammer 40,000 Core Rules designed to improve the player experience, and presents our responses to players’ frequently asked questions. New or revised text is presented in red, with a text highlight applied to revisions made previously (excluding passages that were added or replaced in full).

# UPDATES & ERRATA

# Page 5 – Core Concepts

Add the following:

‘REDEPLOYMENTS

Rules that allow players to redeploy certain units after both armies are deployed (e.g. Huron Blackheart’s Red Corsairs ability) are always resolved after the Deploy Armies step (or, if you are playing a Crusade battle, after the Deploy Crusade Armies step), and before the Determine First Turn step, before determining who has the first turn. When a player uses such a rule, they remove that unit or units from the battlefield, then deploy them again using all the normal rules (for example, if all the models in one of these units have the Infiltrators ability, that unit’s player can set that unit up using that ability). Players alternate resolving any such rules, starting with the Attacker.’

# Page 6 – Unit Coherency, 2nd paragraph

Change to:

‘If for any reason a model cannot be set up in Unit Coherency, or cannot be set up following any restrictions stated by other rules (e.g. while setting up using the Deep Strike ability), that unit cannot be set up. If a unit cannot end a move in Unit Coherency, it cannot make that move and its models are returned to their previous positions.’

# Page 10 – The Battle Round

Add the following:

‘OUT-OF-PHASE RULES

Some rules allow a model or unit to move, shoot, charge or fight outside of the normal turn sequence. For example, the Fire Overwatch Stratagem enables a unit to shoot in your opponent’s turn as if it were your Shooting phase. When using out-of-phase rules to perform an action as if it were one of your phases, you cannot use any other rules that are normally triggered in that phase.

# Page 10 – Persisting Effects

Add the following:

‘Some rules apply an effect that lasts until a certain duration has passed (e.g. until the start of your next turn). Such effects are known as persisting effects. If a persisting effect applies to a unit when it embarks within a Transport, make a note of that effect and its duration; if that unit disembarks for any reason, any persisting effects continue to apply to that unit for their full duration. If a persisting effect applies to an Attached unit and that unit ceases to be an Attached unit (because either all of its Bodyguard models or all of its Leader models are destroyed), any persisting effects continue to apply to the surviving unit(s) for their full duration.’

# Page 11 – Gaining Command Points

Change to:

‘Outside of the 1CP players gain at the start of the Command phase (see right), each player can only gain a total of 1CP per battle round, regardless of the source (this includes other CP gained at the start of the Command phase).’

# Page 11 – Battle-shock

Add the following:

‘In this step, if for any reason a unit is forced to take a Battle-shock test for being below its Starting Strength, unless otherwise stated, that unit does not also have to take a Battle-shock test for being Below Half-strength. While a unit is Battle-shocked, all models in that unit are also Battle-shocked.’

# Example:

In your opponent’s Movement phase, you use the Fire Overwatch Stratagem to enable a Whirlwind from your army to shoot as if it were your Shooting phase. The Whirlwind has the Pinning Bombardment ability, which is used ‘In your Shooting phase, after this model has shot’. Because Fire Overwatch is an out-of-phase rule, it only allows the Whirlwind to perform the specified action (in this case, shooting as if it were your Shooting phase) and does not trigger any other rules that would normally be used in your Shooting phase. This means the Whirlwind’s Pinning Bombardment ability has no effect while resolving these attacks, and you could not use any other Stratagems that are used in your Shooting phase to affect those attacks.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# Move Units

Each time you move a unit, you can move any of its models you choose to. The controlling player chooses the order in which to move their models. Each time you move a model (other than when a model Remains Stationary, see below), you can move it across the battlefield in any combination of straight lines and pivots (see below). While you are moving it, no part of its base can be moved through an enemy model or cross the edge of the battlefield. It can be moved through friendly models, but it cannot end its move on top of another model. The only exception to this is when moving Monster or Vehicle models; such models cannot be moved through other friendly Monster or Vehicle models and must be moved around them instead. While a model (excluding Vehicle models that do not have the Walker keyword) is moving in a straight line, it can be moved through any space its base can fit through, but it cannot end its move somewhere the model cannot be placed.

# 1 MOVING OVERHANGING MODELS

Despite this model’s wings being wider than the gap between the ruins, the model’s base fits between the ruins, so the model can move through the gap.

# Move Units

# Straight Lines

Each time you move a model in a straight line, measure the distance from the same point on its base at the start and end of that line. For example, you can measure from the ‘back’ of the model’s base, and measure the distance to the back of the model’s base at the end of that line. If a model does not have a base, measure using the same point on the model at the start and end of that line.

# Pivots

Each time you pivot a model, rotate it any amount around its central axis (perpendicular to the battlefield through the centre of its base, or through the centre of the model if it doesn’t have a base). The first time you do this during each model’s move, subtract that model’s pivot value (see below) from the remaining distance it can move during that move. If there is not enough distance left to do this, it cannot pivot. Note that the distance it can move is only reduced once for that move, regardless of how many additional times it pivots during that move.

# Pivot Values

Unless otherwise stated, the following pivot values apply.

|MODEL TYPE|PIVOT VALUE|
|---|---|
|Models that are not on a round base (excluding Monster and Vehicle models).|1"|
|Monster and Vehicle models that are not on a round base.|2"|
|Vehicle models on a round base that is wider than 32mm with a flying stem or hover stand.|2"|
|Aircraft models.*|0"|
|All other types of model.|0"|

*Note that Aircraft models have separate rules for pivoting, as described on pages 53-54 of the Core Rules.

# Examples

- As a Monster model on an oval base, a Bloodthirster has a pivot value of 2".
- As a Vehicle model on a 60mm round base with a flying stem, a Raider has a pivot value of 2".
- As a Vehicle model on a 100mm round base with a hover stand, an Impulsor has a pivot value of 2".
- As a non-Monster, non-Vehicle model on an oval base, an Outrider has a pivot value of 1".# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# 2. Centre of a Model Without a Base

To find the centre of a model without a base, draw an imaginary four-sided shape, as small as possible, that contains each part of that model as you look directly down at it. Then draw two imaginary lines across the diagonals of that shape. The point where those two lines intersect is the centre of the model.

# 3. Pivoting Around the Central Axis

# 4. Moving with a Pivot Value of 0"

Central axis

3"

This model has a Move characteristic of 5". It moves 3" in a straight line, then 2" in another straight line. As this model has a pivot value of 0", it can pivot at any time during this move.

# 5. Moving Without Pivoting

This Vehicle has a Move characteristic of 12". It moves 6" in a straight line, then 6" in another straight line, measuring from and to the same point each time it moves. It does not pivot as part of this move.

6"

6"

4# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# Moving with a Pivot

A Vehicle can move with a pivot value of 2".

|6"| |6"|
|---|---|---|
| | |4"|

The same Vehicle moves 6" in a straight line, then 4" in another straight line, pivoting around its central axis at the end of this move. This pivot subtracts its pivot value of 2" from the remaining distance it can move, so it cannot move further.

# Moving with Multiple Pivots

A Vehicle can pivot more than once during its move, but the total distance it can move is still only reduced by its pivot value of 2".

5"

5"
The same Vehicle moves 5" in a straight line, pivoting around its central axis, then 5" in another straight line, pivoting around its central axis again.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# Moving Overhanging Models with a Pivot Value of 2"

|8|MOVING OVERHANGING MODELS WITH A PIVOT VALUE OF 2"|
|---|---|
|6"| |
|4"| |

This Bloodthirster has declared a charge targeting the Terminator Squad. Its Charge roll is 12". The gap in the ruins is wide enough for the model’s base, so it can move through that gap despite its wings. It moves 6" in a straight line, then pivots around its central axis, subtracting its pivot value of 2" from the Charge roll, then moves 4" in a straight line to complete its Charge move.

6# Warhammer 40K Tabletop Game Rules


# Firing Deck

Some Transport models have ‘Firing Deck x’ listed in their abilities. Each time such a model is selected to shoot in the Shooting phase, you can select up to ‘x’ models embarked within it whose units have not already shot this phase. Then, for each of those embarked models, you can select one ranged weapon that embarked model is equipped with (excluding weapons with the [ONE SHOT] ability). Until that Transport model has resolved all of its attacks, it counts as being equipped with all of the weapons you selected in this way, in addition to its other weapons. Until the end of the phase, those selected models’ units are not eligible to shoot.

Firing Deck ‘x’: Each time this Transport shoots, select one weapon (excluding weapons with the [ONE SHOT] ability) from up to ‘x’ models embarked within it whose units have not shot this phase; this Transport counts as being equipped with those weapons as well. Until the end of the phase, those selected models’ units are not eligible to shoot.

# Shooting Phase

Unless at least one model in a unit has an eligible target for one or more of its ranged weapons, that model’s unit cannot be selected to shoot.

Designer’s Note: This doesn’t change the unit’s eligibility to shoot, but it does mean that a unit can’t be selected to shoot at nothing, and therefore won’t qualify for other rules triggers (e.g. Gargoyles’ Winged Swarm ability and Dark Pacts).

# Big Guns Never Tire

Each time a Monster or Vehicle unit makes a ranged attack, if that unit was within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units when it selected its targets, unless that attack is made with a Pistol (pg 25), subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll.

# Mortal Wounds

Some rules inflict mortal wounds on units. Each time mortal wounds are inflicted on a unit, each of those mortal wounds inflicts one point of damage to that unit, and they are always applied one at a time. Each mortal wound is allocated to a model in the same manner as allocating an attack. Excess damage from mortal wounds is not lost if the damage can be allocated to another model. Instead, keep allocating damage to another model in the target unit until either all the damage has been allocated or the target unit is destroyed.

If an attack inflicts mortal wounds in addition to any normal damage, do not make a Wound roll or saving throw (including invulnerable saving throws) against those mortal wounds. If those mortal wounds are inflicted by an attack that has the [PRECISION] ability, the attacking model’s controlling player can allocate those mortal wounds to a Character model in that unit.

- Each mortal wound inflicted on a unit causes one model in that unit to lose one wound.
- Unless the source of the mortal wounds is the [HAZARDOUS] ability or an attack with the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability, damage from mortal wounds is not lost if it can be allocated to another model.
- No saving throws can be made against mortal wounds.
- Mortal wounds inflicted by attacks always apply after any normal damage, even if that damage was saved.

# Indirect Fire

Weapons with [INDIRECT FIRE] in their profile are known as Indirect Fire weapons, and attacks can be made with them even if the target is not visible to the attacking model. These attacks can destroy enemy models in a target unit even though none may have been visible to the attacking unit when you selected that target.

If no models in a target unit are visible to the attacking unit when you select that target, then each time a model in the attacking unit makes an attack against that target using an Indirect Fire weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll, an unmodified Hit roll of 1-3 always fails, and the target has the Benefit of Cover against that attack (pg 44). Weapons with the [TORRENT] ability cannot be fired using the [INDIRECT FIRE] ability.

Example: An enemy unit is targeted by an attacking model equipped with a weapon with the [INDIRECT FIRE] ability. No models in the target unit are visible to the attacking model, so when resolving the attacks with that weapon, subtract 1 from the Hit roll, unmodified Hit rolls of 1-3 fail to hit, and each time an attack is allocated to a model in the target unit, it has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.

- Can target and make attacks against units that are not visible to the attacking unit.
- If no models are visible in a target unit when it is selected, then when making an attack against that target with an Indirect Fire weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll, an unmodified Hit roll of 1-3 always fails, and the target has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.

If mortal wounds are being inflicted as a result of the [HAZARDOUS] ability or by an attack with the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS]# Warhammer 40K Tabletop Game Rules


# Page 28 – Hazardous

Change to:

‘Weapons with [HAZARDOUS] in their profile are known as Hazardous weapons. Each time a unit is selected to shoot or fight, after that unit has resolved all of its attacks, for each Hazardous weapon that targets were selected for when resolving those attacks, that unit must take one Hazardous test. To do so, roll one D6: on a 1, that test is failed. For each failed test you must resolve the following sequence (resolve each failed test one at a time):
- If possible, select one model in that unit that has lost one or more wounds and is equipped with one or more Hazardous weapons.
- Otherwise, if possible, select one model in that unit (excluding Character models) equipped with one or more Hazardous weapons.
- Otherwise, select one Character model in that unit equipped with one or more Hazardous weapons.

If a model was selected, that unit suffers 3 mortal wounds and when allocating those mortal wounds, they must be allocated to the selected model.

If a unit from a player’s army is selected as the target of the Fire Overwatch Stratagem in their opponent’s Charge phase, any mortal wounds inflicted by Hazardous tests are allocated after the charging unit has ended its Charge move.’

# Page 28 – Extra Attacks

Change to:

‘Weapons with [EXTRA ATTACKS] in their profile are known as Extra Attacks weapons. Each time the bearer of one or more Extra Attacks weapons fights, it makes attacks with each of the Extra Attacks melee weapons it is equipped with and it makes attacks with one of the melee weapons it is equipped with that does not have the [EXTRA ATTACKS] ability (if any). The number of attacks made with an Extra Attacks weapon cannot be modified by other rules, unless that weapon’s name is explicitly specified in that rule.’

# Page 28 – Devastating Wounds

Change to:

‘Weapons with [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] in their profile are known as Devastating Wounds weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if that attack scores a Critical Wound, no saving throw of any kind can be made against that attack (including invulnerable saving throws). Such attacks are only allocated to models after all other attacks made by the attacking unit have been allocated and resolved. After that attack is allocated and after any modifiers are applied, it inflicts a number of mortal wounds on the target equal to the Damage characteristic of that attack, instead of inflicting damage normally.’

# Page 38 – Profiles

Change to:

‘These contain the following characteristics that tell you how mighty the models in the unit are:
- Move (M): This is the speed at which a model moves across the battlefield. If a model has a Move of ‘-’ it is unable to move at all. After all modifiers are applied, this cannot be less than 1".
- Toughness (T): This reflects the model’s resilience against physical harm. After all modifiers are applied, this cannot be less than 1.
- Save (Sv): This indicates the protection a model’s armour gives them. After all modifiers are applied, this cannot be 1+ or better.
- Wounds (W): Wounds represent how much damage a model can sustain before it succumbs to its injuries. If a model’s Wounds characteristic is reduced to 0, that model is destroyed.
- Leadership (Ld): This reveals how courageous, determined or self-controlled a model is. The lower this number, the better a model’s Leadership is. After all modifiers are applied, this cannot be 4+ (or better), or 9+ (or worse).
- Objective Control (OC): This shows how effectively a model can exert control over an objective on the battlefield. After all modifiers are applied, this cannot be less than 0.

# Page 38 – Weapons

Change to:

‘Weapons are described with the following characteristics:
- Range: How far the weapon can shoot. Weapons with a range of ‘Melee’ are melee weapons and can only be used in close combat. All other weapons are ranged weapons. For ranged weapons, after all modifiers are applied, this cannot be less than 1".
- Attacks (A): This tells you how many attacks are made each time that weapon is used. After all modifiers are applied, this cannot be less than 1.
- Weapon Skill (WS): This reflects the bearer’s skill in wielding the relevant melee weapon. After all modifiers are applied, this cannot be 1+ or better.
- Ballistic Skill (BS): This shows how accurate the bearer is when shooting with the relevant ranged weapon. After all modifiers are applied, this cannot be 1+ or better.
- Strength (S): How likely the weapon is to wound a foe. After all modifiers are applied, this cannot be less than 1.
- Armour Penetration (AP): This represents the weapon’s ability to cut through the target’s defences. After all modifiers are applied, this cannot be worse than 0.
- Damage (D): The amount of damage inflicted by a successful wound. After all modifiers are applied, this cannot be less than 1. The exception to this is where a rule specifies that you can change the Damage characteristic to 0.

# Page 39 – Deep Strike

Add the following:

‘If a unit with the Deep Strike ability arrives from Strategic Reserves, the controlling player can choose for that unit to be set up either using the rules for Strategic Reserves or using the Deep Strike ability.’# Warhammer 40K Tabletop Game Rules

# Page 39 – Scouts

Change to:

‘Some units have ‘Scouts x"’ listed in their abilities. If every model in a unit has this ability, then at the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins, it can make a Normal move of up to x", with the exception that, while making that move, the distance moved by each model in that unit can be greater than that model's Move characteristic, as long as it is not greater than x".

Dedicated Transport models can make use of any Scouts x" ability listed in their abilities, or a Scouts x" ability that a unit that starts the battle embarked within that Dedicated Transport model has (provided only models with this ability are embarked within that Dedicated Transport model), regardless of how that embarked unit gained this ability (e.g. listed in their abilities, conferred by an Enhancement or by an attached Character, etc.).

A unit that moves using this ability must end that move more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models. If both players have units that can do this, the player who is taking the first turn moves their units first.’

# Page 39 – Leader

Add the following:

‘Each time the last model in a Bodyguard unit is destroyed, each Character unit that is part of that Attached unit becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks.

Each time the last model in a Character unit that is attached to a Bodyguard unit is destroyed and there is not another Character unit attached, that Attached unit’s Bodyguard unit becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks. Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.

Example: If you only destroy the Bodyguard unit that is part of an Attached unit, you have not destroyed a Character unit. If you only destroy the Character unit that is part of an Attached unit, or if you destroy the whole Attached unit, you have destroyed one Character unit.’

# Page 41 – Command Re-roll Stratagem

Change to:

# COMMAND RE-ROLL

CORE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

A great commander can bend even the vagaries of fate and fortune to their will, the better to ensure victory.

1CP

WHEN: Any phase, just after you make an Advance roll, a Charge roll, a Desperate Escape test or a Hazardous test for a unit from your army, or a Hit roll, a Wound roll, a Damage roll or a saving throw for a model in that unit, or a roll to determine the number of attacks made with a weapon equipped by a model in that unit. If you are using fast dice rolling (pg 24), this Stratagem can still be used after rolling multiple rolls or saving throws at once.

TARGET: That unit or model from your army.

EFFECT: You re-roll that roll, test or saving throw. If you are using fast dice rolling, select one of those rolls or saving throws to re-roll.

# Page 42 – Insane Bravery Stratagem

Change to:

# INSANE BRAVERY

CORE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Indifferent to their own survival, these warriors hold their ground against seemingly impossible odds.

1CP

WHEN: Battle-shock step of your Command phase, just before you take a Battle-shock test for a unit from your army (pg 11).

TARGET: That unit from your army.

EFFECT: Your unit automatically passes that Battle-shock test.

RESTRICTIONS: You cannot use this Stratagem more than once per battle.

# Page 42 – Grenade Stratagem

Change to:

# GRENADE

Priming their hand-held projectiles, these warriors draw back and hurl death into the enemy’s midst.

1CP

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

TARGET: One Grenades unit from your army (excluding units that Advanced, Fell Back or have shot this turn) that is not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.

EFFECT: Select one Grenades model in your unit and one enemy unit that is not within Engagement Range of one or more units from your army and is within 8" of and visible to your Grenades model. Roll six D6: for each 4+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound.# Warhammer 40K Stratagems and Rules


# Tank Shock Stratagem

# TANK SHOCK

CORE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Ramming the foe with a speeding vehicle may be an unsubtle tactic, but it is a murderously effective one.

1CP

WHEN: Your Charge phase, just after a Vehicle unit from your army ends a Charge move.

TARGET: That Vehicle unit.

EFFECT: Select one enemy unit within Engagement Range of your unit, and select one Vehicle model in your unit that is within Engagement Range of that enemy unit. Roll a number of D6 equal to the Toughness characteristic of the selected Vehicle model. For each 5+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound (to a maximum of 6 mortal wounds).

# Fire Overwatch Stratagem

# FIRE OVERWATCH

CORE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

A hail of wildfire can drive back advancing foes.

1CP

WHEN: Your opponent’s Movement or Charge phase, just after an enemy unit is set up or when an enemy unit starts or ends a Normal, Advance, Fall Back or Charge move.

EFFECT: If that enemy unit is visible to your unit, your unit can shoot that enemy unit as if it were your Shooting phase.

RESTRICTIONS: You cannot target a Titanic unit with this Stratagem. Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes a ranged attack, an unmodified Hit roll of 6 is required to score a hit, irrespective of the attacking weapon’s Ballistic Skill or any modifiers. You can only use this Stratagem once per turn.

Be it cunning strategy, potent technology or supernatural ritual, there are many means by which a commander may hasten their warriors’ onset.

1CP

WHEN: End of your opponent’s Movement phase.

TARGET: One unit from your army that is in Reserves.

EFFECT: Your unit can arrive on the battlefield as if it were the Reinforcements step of your Movement phase, and if every model in that unit has the Deep Strike ability, you can set that unit up as described in the Deep Strike ability (even though it is not your Movement phase).

RESTRICTIONS: You cannot use this Stratagem to enable a unit to arrive on the battlefield during a battle round it would not normally be able to do so in.

# Heroic Intervention Stratagem

# HEROIC INTERVENTION

CORE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Voices raised in furious war cries, your warriors surge forth to meet the enemy’s onslaught head-on.

1CP

WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase, just after an enemy unit ends a Charge move.

TARGET: One unit from your army that is within 6" of that enemy unit and would be eligible to declare a charge against that enemy unit if it were your Charge phase.

RESTRICTIONS: You can only select a Vehicle unit from your army if it is a Walker. Note that even if this charge is successful, your unit does not receive any Charge bonus this turn (pg 29).

# Ruins Movement Section

Change to:

- Infantry, Imperium Primarch, Belisarius Cawl and Beast models can move through this terrain feature (walls, floors, ceilings, gantries, chains, etc.) as if it were not there. A model cannot end a move within a wall, a floor, etc.
- Infantry, Imperium Primarch, Belisarius Cawl, Beasts and Fly models can be set up or end a move on any floor level of this terrain feature, but if that level is not the ground floor, such models can only do so if their base does not overhang the floor at that level (if a model does not have a base, no part of that model that would be in contact with the battlefield at ground level can overhang that floor). All other models can only be set up or end a move on the ground floor of this terrain feature.# Warhammer 40K Rules Update


# Page 48 – Ruins, Visibility section

Change to:

‘Models cannot see over or through this terrain feature (i.e. a unit outside this terrain feature cannot draw line of sight to a target on the other side of it, even if it would be possible to draw line of sight to that target through open windows, doors, etc.) Aircraft models are exceptions to this – visibility to and from such models is determined normally, even if this terrain feature is wholly in between them and the observing model. Models can see into this terrain feature normally, and models that are wholly within this terrain feature can see out of it normally. Models that are within this terrain feature can be seen normally and Towering models that are within this terrain feature can also see out of it normally.’

# Page 56 – Select Units, 2nd sentence

Change to:

‘Your army must include at least one Character model that is eligible to be your Warlord. Some rules grant the Battleline keyword to additional units from your army – typically if you select a particular Detachment or if your Warlord is a specific model. When mustering your army, treat such units as Battleline units for the purposes of this step, even though the Select Warlord step comes afterwards.’

# Q: Where on a model do I measure from when determining if something is within range of an Aura ability?

# A:

You measure from the base (or the closest point of any part of that model if it does not have a base), as described in Measuring Distances on page 7 of the Core Rules.

# Q: After all modifiers are applied, can a Save characteristic ever be 1+ or better?

# A:

No.

# TIMING/SEQUENCING

# Q: If a Stratagem used in the Command phase does not explicitly state that it is used in the Battle-shock step or at the end of the Command phase, is it always used in the Command step?

# A:

Yes.

# Q: If there are rules that take effect with the same timing as when Primary and Secondary Missions are checked for scoring VP, are such rules resolved before or after the Primary and Secondary Missions are checked for scoring VP?

# A:

Before. All rules take effect before any Primary or Secondary Missions are checked for scoring VP.

# Page 58 – Objective Markers, 4th paragraph, 3rd sentence

Change to:

‘A player will control an objective marker at the end of any phase or turn if their Level of Control over it is greater than their opponent’s.’

# FAQS

# GENERAL

# Q: If a Stratagem targets both one or more units from my army and one or more units from my opponent’s army, can I use an ability to modify that Stratagem’s CP cost?

# A:

Yes.

# Q: If a Stratagem targets two or more units from my army, can I use an ability to modify that Stratagem’s CP cost?

# A:

Yes.

# Q: If a model has a rule that allows it to shoot or fight after a certain condition is met (such as being targeted by an attack), how many times can it shoot or fight as a result of that rule within a phase?

# A:

As many times as the relevant condition is met, unless otherwise stated.

# Q: When a rule allows a model to shoot or fight after being destroyed, but before being removed from play, does that model’s unit count as having been selected to shoot or fight?

# A:

No. As such, any rules with that trigger do not apply.

# Q: When an attack targets a Leader unit that contains one or more models that have the Character keyword and one or more models that do not have the Character keyword, if that Leader unit is not an Attached unit, can that attack be allocated to a Character model in that unit?

# A:

Yes.

# Q: If some rules take effect at the start of a phase, turn or battle round and another rule takes effect during that same phase, turn or battle round without specifying the start, can that latter rule take effect before all of those other rules are resolved?

# A:

No. All rules that take effect at the start of a phase, turn or battle round must be fully resolved before any rules that do not specify they take effect at the start of that phase, turn or battle round.

# Q: Each time a unit becomes Battle-shocked, do the effects of any previously used Stratagems that are still affecting that unit stop applying?

# A:

No.

# Q: As all objective markers begin the battle in the contested state, is it ever possible for a player to control that objective marker before the end of the first player’s Command phase?

# A:

No.

# Q: If a unit from your army has a rule that allows it to be the target of a Stratagem, even if that Stratagem has already been used by you earlier that phase, what happens if you have not used that Stratagem yet that phase? Can you use that Stratagem again later in the phase as a result?

# A:

No, unless that later usage of that Stratagem also targets a unit with such an ability.

# Q: If a rule would apply when a model or unit is destroyed, but another rule is also preventing that model or unit from being destroyed, does the former rule take effect?

# A:

No, unless that model is only temporarily prevented from being removed from play, at which point such a rule would take effect.# Warhammer 40K Rules and Gameplay


# Rules Interactions

# Characteristic Modifications

Q: If a model is subject to two rules that set a characteristic to a particular value (e.g. the Norn Emissary’s Singular Purpose ability and being Battle-shocked), which rule is resolved first?

A: The order is determined by the active player, or if it is at the start or end of a battle round, players roll off to determine who chooses. In the example, in the controlling player’s turn, they could choose for the Battle-shocked rule to take effect, setting the Objective Control characteristic to 0, and then the Singular Purpose ability to take effect, setting the final Objective Control characteristic to 15. In their opponent’s turn, however, their opponent could choose to apply the rules in the opposite order, resulting in a final Objective Control characteristic of 0.

# Visibility and Battlefield Edges

Q: When a model overhangs the edge of the battlefield, how does that affect its visibility?

A: That model’s player can draw line of sight from any part of that model that is not overhanging the edge of the battlefield. Their opponent can draw line of sight to any part of that model.

# Deployment Rules

Q: In the Deploy Armies step, if a model has to be set up in your deployment zone, can parts of that model overhang your deployment zone?

A: No, unless that model is too large to do otherwise, in which case, as much of that model as possible must be set up within your deployment zone.

# Optional Rules Activation

Q: If both players have rules that they can optionally decide to activate or not (e.g. Ork players calling a Waaagh!) and those decisions are made at the same time, in what order must those players decide whether to use such rules?

A: If it is during a player’s turn, that player decides first, then their opponent does. If it is not during a player’s turn, the players roll off and the loser of the roll must decide first, followed by their opponent.

# Attack Resolution

Q: Each time a unit from a player’s army shoots or fights, if an enemy unit is destroyed by those attacks while there are still unresolved attacks left to make against it, do those remaining attacks need to be resolved?

A: No, although if any of those attacks are made with weapons with the [ONE SHOT] ability, those weapons will still have been shot. Similarly, Hazardous tests will need to be taken for any weapons with the [HAZARDOUS] ability making those unresolved attacks.

# Damage Characteristics

Q: If a rule adds to the Damage characteristic of an attack (e.g. the [MELTA] ability) and another rule changes the Damage characteristic to 0 (e.g. the Thousand Sons Destined By Fate Stratagem), will the final Damage characteristic be 0?

A: No, rules that change the Damage characteristic to 0 take effect first, then other modifiers are applied, including the [MELTA] ability. In the example, if the attacking weapon had the [MELTA 2] ability, the Damage characteristic would be changed to 0 first, then the [MELTA 2] ability would add 2 to the Damage characteristic, for a final Damage characteristic of 2.

# Out-of-Phase Rules

Q: Can a Monster or Vehicle unit that is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units be targeted with the Fire Overwatch Stratagem because of the Big Guns Never Tire rule?

A: No. Big Guns Never Tire allows a unit to shoot in its controlling player’s Shooting phase, but such rules do not take effect in other phases.

Q: Can rules that specify they only take effect in the controlling player’s Shooting phase be used when shooting with the Fire Overwatch Stratagem, e.g. the Firing Deck ability?

A: No, as per out-of-phase rules (see Core Rules, page 10).

# Positioning and Movement

Q: Can models overhang the edge of the battlefield?

A: Yes, as long as the model’s base or hull (see ‘Hull’ in the Rules Commentary) is wholly on the battlefield.

Q: If a model is within range of multiple objective markers, when determining Level of Control over those objective markers, does that model’s Objective Control characteristic count towards each of them?

A: Yes.

Q: When determining if a unit that is partially within (but not wholly within) a terrain feature is visible to another unit, is true line of sight used as normal?

A: Yes.

Q: When making a Normal move, is it ever possible for a model to move a distance in inches greater than its Move characteristic?

A: No.

Q: Can a unit with a minimum Move characteristic be affected by a rule that would cause it to move less than that minimum Move characteristic?

A: No.

Q: When a rule instructs a player that they must set up a unit on the battlefield (e.g. disembarking from a destroyed Transport, Emergency Disembarkation, a Drop Pod’s Drop Pod Assault ability), if there is not enough space to set up every model in that unit while adhering to any limitations on where those models can be set up, what happens to the unit and the models that cannot be set up?

A: The unit can still be set up, but any models that cannot be are destroyed (see ‘Set Up on the Battlefield’ in the Rules Commentary). Those models are considered to have been destroyed by the opponent’s army, but not by any specific models or units.

Q: If a unit Falls Back, one or more models from that unit are destroyed, and then one or more models are returned to the battlefield, does the unit and/or those returned models still count as having Fallen Back that turn?

A: Yes. The same is true for any other type move.

Q: If a unit Falls Back and then becomes a repositioned unit (see ‘Repositioned Units’ in the Rules Commentary), does it still count as having Fallen Back that turn?

A: Yes. The same is true for any other type of move.

Q: Can models be returned to a unit that is on the battlefield, but was not on the battlefield at the start of the phase?

A: No (see ‘Adding Models to a Unit’ in the Rules Commentary).# Warhammer 40K Transport and Reserves Rules

# TRANSPORTS

# Q: A Transport arriving from Strategic Reserves must be set up wholly within 6" of a battlefield edge; does this also apply to units that disembark from that Transport in the same turn?

A: No. Such units disembark normally, provided they are set up more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy units.

# Q: When a Transport with multiple embarked units is destroyed, do all of those units have to disembark before rolling for mortal wounds?

A: Yes.

# Q: When a Transport with multiple embarked units is destroyed, who decides the order in which those units disembark?

A: That Transport’s controlling player decides.

# Q: When using a Transport’s rule that allows a unit to be split before the battle (e.g. Adepta Sororitas Immolators, Drukhari Venoms, etc.), what is the points value of half of that split unit for the purposes of placing it into Strategic Reserves?

A: Halve the points value of the original unit for the purposes of the 25% Strategic Reserves limit.

# Q: Can the Fire Overwatch Stratagem be used to shoot at a unit that just disembarked from a Transport?

A: Yes. This includes units that just disembarked from a Transport that arrived from Reserves in the same phase.

# Q: Can a unit embarked within a Transport make use of any rules it has to affect that Transport? For example, if a Lieutenant is embarked within a Rhino, does its Target Priority ability let that Rhino shoot and declare a charge in a turn in which it Fell Back?

A: No. The only rules that take effect while the units possessing them are embarked within a Transport are those that explicitly state that they take effect while such a unit is embarked.

# Q: A unit that arrives from Reserves counts as having made a Normal move; can it embark within a Transport as a result?

A: No.

# Q: If a rule allows a unit to make a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move outside of its controlling player’s Movement phase, just after making that move, can that unit embark within a friendly Transport model?

A: Yes, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

# Q: When a Transport is equipped with additional ranged weapons due to the Firing Deck ability, do those weapons benefit from any extra abilities or rules that might be conferred on them by the embarked models?

A: Only if those embarked models’ rules explicitly state that they still apply while embarked within a Transport.

# Q: Can a Transport use the Firing Deck ability to shoot with a weapon equipped by a model that Fell Back this turn? Can a Transport use the Firing Deck ability to shoot with a weapon equipped by a model that Advanced this turn if that weapon does not have the [ASSAULT] ability?

A: Yes in both cases.

# RESERVES

# Q: Are the limits placed on Reserves and Strategic Reserves separate?

A: Strategic Reserves units are also Reserves units. As such, any restrictions placed on Reserves by a mission pack (e.g. Chapter Approved: Pariah Nexus) also apply to Strategic Reserves.

# Q: Do units in Reserves meet the requirements for being eligible to shoot?

A: Yes, units in Reserves are eligible to shoot. However, unless at least one model in a unit has an eligible target for one or more of its ranged weapons, that model’s unit cannot be selected to shoot.

# Q: When a unit is set up on the battlefield from Reserves, it is unable to move for the rest of the phase. Can such a unit make use of an ability in another phase to let them move (e.g. the Lieutenant in Phobos Armour’s Strategic Dispersal ability)?

A: Yes.

# Q: If a unit is in Reserves and some of the models in that unit have the Deep Strike ability, but not all of the models have it, can that unit be set up on the battlefield using the Deep Strike ability when arriving from Reserves?

A: No.

# Q: If a unit from your army has a rule that allows it to be set up on the battlefield from Reserves in the first battle round, can that unit be set up in the Reinforcements step of your opponent’s Movement phase, using the Rapid Ingress Stratagem?

A: Yes, unless that rule explicitly states that it applies in your Movement phase, in which case it is prevented by the restrictions for out-of-phase rules.

# Q: When setting up a unit from Strategic Reserves, does the entire unit have to be set up within the necessary distance of one or more battlefield edges?

A: When setting up that unit, it must be set up wholly within the distance specified from one battlefield edge. This can mean that a unit can be set up wholly within the distance specified from one or more battlefield edges, but you only measure the distance from one of those battlefield edges.

# Q: If a model is too large to be able to set it up within the restrictions described by Strategic Reserves, can it still be placed in Strategic Reserves and later be set up on the battlefield?

A: Yes, but it must be set up so that it is touching your battlefield edge (while still being more than 9" from all enemy units and adhering to any other placement limitations). During a turn in which such a large model is set up on the battlefield, that model’s unit cannot do any of the following: make a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move; Remain Stationary; make any attacks with ranged weapons; declare a charge.

# Q: Do Aircraft models that have been set up in Reserves count towards the limits on how much of a player’s army can be placed into Strategic Reserves?

A: No. In the Declare Battle Formations step, Aircraft models only count as being in Reserves, not Strategic Reserves. They only start to be treated as being in Strategic Reserves after the battle has started.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# Strategic Reserves

# Q: If a unit that started the battle on the battlefield is later placed into Strategic Reserves, in what battle rounds can it be set back up on the battlefield?

A: If the mission pack allows it (e.g. Chapter Approved: Pariah Nexus), then in any battle round (provided that unit has a rule that describes how it will arrive from Strategic Reserves). Otherwise, from the second battle round onwards.

# Q: Can a unit in Reserves be the target of a Stratagem?

A: Yes, if all other requirements in the Target section of that Stratagem are met.

# Command Phase

# Q: If a rule that takes effect once per battle explicitly gives a player more than 1CP in a battle round (e.g. the Imperial Knights Code Chivalric army rule), does that rule ignore the limitations on how many CP a player can gain in a battle round?

A: Yes.

# Mustering Armies

# Q: In the Muster Your Army rules, it says that no unit can have more than one Enhancement. If a unit is able to have two Character units attached to it in the Declare Battle Formations step, can each of those Character units have an Enhancement?

A: Yes, this restriction only applies in the Muster Armies step.

# Psychic Abilities/Attacks

# Q: Are all mortal wounds inflicted by a Psychic ability, including any caused to the unit with that ability, inflicted by a Psychic Attack?

A: Yes.

# Q: Do Doombolt and similar abilities count as Psychic Attacks for the purposes of the Feel No Pain ability against Psychic Attacks?

A: Yes.

# Q: Is it possible for a unit to be made to take Battle-shock tests in both the Command step of the Command phase and the Battle-shock step of the Command phase?

A: Yes.

# Q: If a rule takes effect in your Command phase and doesn’t explicitly state that it happens in the Battle-shock step or at the end of the Command phase (e.g. the Tyranids Shadow in the Warp army rule), does it always take place in the Command step?

A: Yes.

# Q: When Hazardous weapons inflict one or more mortal wounds as a result of a failed Hazardous test, if that weapon is also a Psychic weapon, are those mortal wounds inflicted by a Psychic Attack?

A: Yes.

# Q: Can a unit be made to take more than one Battle-shock test in the Battle-shock step of the Command phase?

A: No, but a unit can be made to take more than one Battle-shock test in all other phases, as well as the Command step of the Command phase.

# Fight Phase

# Q: After a unit fights, is it required to Consolidate even if its controlling player does not want it to?

A: Yes, Consolidation for a unit is not optional. However, during that Consolidation, for each model in that unit, whether or not that model makes a Consolidation move is optional.

# Actions and Missions

# Q: If an Action states in its Units section that one unit can perform it, is it possible for multiple units to each be performing one instance of that Action?

A: No, only one unit from an army can be performing that Action at any one time.

# Q: For Primary and Secondary Missions that award VP for destroying Character models or units, if those models or units are returned to the battlefield and then subsequently destroyed again, will such Primary and Secondary Missions award VP for them being destroyed again?

A: Yes, unless that Primary or Secondary Mission specifies otherwise.# Warhammer 40,000 Rules Commentary Version 1.4

# WARHAMMER 40,000

# RULES COMMENTARY VERSION 1.4

While streamlined at its core, Warhammer 40,000 is a game of endless variety, and can involve nuanced circumstances that may give even experienced players pause. This commentary is a living resource of definitions, diagrams and examples intended to clarify some of the game’s finer points and resolve niche questions that might otherwise slow down the pace of battle. New or revised text is presented in red.

# Abilities with the Same Name

Abilities with the same name (excluding Aura abilities) can affect units multiple times, but if such an ability applies a named condition to a unit (e.g. ‘suppressed’), that condition can only affect the target unit once at any given time.

Example 1: Anna has two Great Unclean Ones in her army, and targets her opponent’s Intercessor Squad with both of those models’ Nurgle’s Rot ability. As this ability is not an Aura, it can be applied multiple times to the target unit, reducing the Toughness characteristic of models in the Intercessor Squad by 1 for each use of the ability, for a total reduction of 2 in this case.

Example 2: Sean has two Kustom Boosta-blastas in his army, and targets his opponent’s Aggressor Squad with both of those models’ Rivetin’ Dakka ability. As this ability is not an Aura, it can be applied multiple times to the target unit, but as it applies the ‘suppressed’ condition, its effects will only apply once (subtracting 1 from the Hit roll in this case), regardless of how many times the target unit is suppressed.

# Active Player

The player whose turn is taking place is said to be the active player.

# Adding Models to a Unit

Some rules allow you to add models to a unit during the battle. Models added to a unit that is on the battlefield must be set up in Unit Coherency with models in that unit that started that phase on the battlefield (i.e. models that were already on the battlefield when that rule was used). Models added to a unit that is not currently on the battlefield do not have to meet this requirement. A model added to a unit during the battle can be set up within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units, but only if those enemy units are already within Engagement Range of the unit that model is being added to. When adding models to a unit as described above, any models that cannot be set up due to insufficient space are considered to have been destroyed, but do not trigger any rules that are triggered when a model is destroyed.

# Additional Hits

Some rules cause attacks to score additional hits on a Critical Hit (e.g. [SUSTAINED HITS]). If the attacking model is also benefiting from any other rules that trigger on a Critical Hit (e.g. [LETHAL HITS]), only the original attack benefits from those rules. Any additional hits scored as the result of a Critical Hit are automatically successful (see Automatically Successful).

# Affected by a Stratagem

If a unit is selected as the target of a Stratagem, it is said to be affected by that Stratagem. Note that the New Orders Stratagem targets an active Secondary Mission card rather than any units, so can always be used (assuming you have the CP to do so) even if all units from your army are Battle-shocked.

# After

See Just After.

# Against (an attack)

When making an attack, if a saving throw is made, that saving throw is said to be made against that attack.

# Against (an attack with an ‘X’ characteristic of ‘Y’)

Some rules only apply against an attack with a specific characteristic. If the characteristic involved is AP or Damage, such rules are applied at the Allocate Attack step of the attack sequence (e.g. ‘Each time an attack with a Damage characteristic of 1 is allocated to a model in this unit, add 1 to any armour saving throw made against that attack’). Otherwise, they are applied at the start of the attack sequence.

# All Models (in this unit can each have their Weapon A replaced with 1 Weapon B)

When this wargear option is selected for a unit, every model in that unit equipped with Weapon A must replace it with Weapon B. It is not possible for only some of those models to replace that weapon and for others not to.

# Any Number of Models (can each have their Weapon A replaced with 1 Weapon B)

When this wargear option is selected for a unit, any number of models in that unit equipped with Weapon A can each replace it with Weapon B. It is possible for only some of those models to replace that weapon and for others not to.

# Any

If a rule applies to ‘any’, it means ‘one or more’. For example, ‘While this model is within Engagement Range of any enemy units’ is the same as ‘While this model is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units’.

# Army

A player’s army consists of every unit on their Army Roster and any units that are added to it over the course of the battle.

# Arriving as Reinforcements/from Strategic Reserves

When a Reinforcements/Strategic Reserves unit is set up on the battlefield (other than when disembarking from a Transport), it is said to have arrived as Reinforcements/from Strategic Reserves.

Example: An attack with the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] and [LETHAL HITS] abilities scores a Critical Hit. That attack automatically wounds the target due to [LETHAL HITS], but it also scores one additional hit due to [SUSTAINED HITS 1]. This additional hit does not benefit from the [LETHAL HITS] ability, so a Wound roll is made for it as normal.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# As Close as Possible

If a rule instructs you to move a model ‘as close as possible’ to a unit, model or objective marker, you must end that model’s move in base-to-base contact with that unit, model or objective marker if its move is sufficient to do so without breaking any other restrictions (such as Unit Coherency), or as close as you can achieve if its move is not sufficient. If a model is already as close as possible to a unit, model or objective marker when it is instructed to make a move as close as possible towards a unit, model or objective marker, that model cannot be moved, but still counts as having made the move in question. The exception to this is that a model with a pivot value of 0" (see Pivot Value in the Core Rules, page 13) and a round base that is as close as possible to an enemy model or objective marker can pivot when its unit Piles In or Consolidates.

# Attached Units with Multiple Characters (allocating attacks)

Some units can have more than one Leader unit attached to them, and so can contain more than one Character model. Each time an attack with the [PRECISION] ability successfully wounds such a unit, the attacking model’s controlling player can choose to have that attack allocated to any visible Character model in that unit, rather than following the normal attack sequence.

# Attached Units with Multiple Characters (no more than two)

Some models have rules that allow them to be attached to a specified unit even if another specified Character is already attached to that unit (e.g. Lieutenant models attaching to units already led by a Captain or Chapter Master). In all such cases, only one additional model with rules to this effect can be added to a unit already led by a different Character.

Example: An Intercessor Squad has a Captain attached to it. You cannot attach both a Lieutenant and an Apothecary to that unit, even though both of those models have rules to that effect – only one of those units can be attached alongside that Captain.

# Automatically Wounds

If an attack automatically wounds, the Wound roll for that attack is automatically successful (see Automatically Successful).

# Base

Most models are mounted on a base. A model’s base is always considered to be part of the model.

# Base-to-Base Contact

When two models’ bases are touching, they are in base-to-base contact and are as close as possible (see As Close as Possible). When moving a model from your army into base-to-base contact with an enemy model during a Pile-in or Consolidation move, if that enemy model overhangs its base such that it is not possible to move your model into base-to-base contact with that model, until the end of the turn, those models are considered to be in base-to-base contact with each other, and within Engagement Range of each other, while all of the following are true:

- The distance your model could move was sufficient to move it into base-to-base contact with the enemy model if there was no overhang.
- You have moved your model as close as possible to the enemy model.
- Any part of one model is within 1" of any part of the other model.

(See Charging with a Unit).

# Battleline if…

Some rules grant the Battleline keyword to additional units from your army – typically if you select a particular Detachment or if your Warlord is a specific model. When mustering your army, treat such units as Battleline units for the purposes of the Select Units step, even though the Select Warlord step comes afterwards.

# Battlefield Edge

The battlefield is bordered by four battlefield edges.

# Attack’s Characteristics

When making an attack, that attack is considered to have the same characteristics and abilities as the weapon making that attack. If any modifiers apply to the characteristics or abilities of an attack, those changes do not apply to the weapon it is made with, nor do they apply to any other attacks made with that weapon.

# Automatically Hits

If an attack automatically hits, the Hit roll for that attack is automatically successful (see Automatically Successful).

# Automatically Passes

See Automatically Successful.

# AUTOMATICALLY SUCCESSFUL

When a dice roll is automatically successful, the following applies:

- If a roll is automatically successful, do not roll the dice. Any rules that take effect on a particular dice result or roll result do not take effect if the roll they refer to is automatically successful.
- If a Hit roll is automatically successful, move straight to the Wound roll. Such a Hit roll is not a Critical Hit, and does not trigger any effects that are triggered by a Critical Hit.
- If a Wound roll is automatically successful, move straight to the allocation of that attack. Such a Wound roll is not a Critical Wound, and does not trigger any effects that are triggered by a Critical Wound.

# Battlefield Quarter

See Table Quarter.

# Battle-shock Tests

2D6 roll required by each unit in your army that is Below Half-strength in your Command phase (Core Rules, page 11). If the result is less than the unit’s Leadership characteristic, then until the start of your next Command phase, that unit is Battle-shocked. Note that this is true even if that unit is subsequently destroyed, which can determine whether or not you can target that unit with a Stratagem. Some rules require a unit to take a Battle-shock test during a phase other than the Command phase, and even when not Below Half-strength. Units that are already Battle-shocked must still take another Battle-shock test in such cases, in case the result triggers any additional effects, but passing or failing that test does not change that unit’s Battle-shocked status (i.e. a pass will not result in that unit no longer being Battle-shocked, and a failure will not result in that unit being Battle-shocked for any longer duration). In the Battle-shock step of the Command phase, if for any reason a unit is forced to take a Battle-shock test for being below its Starting Strength, unless otherwise stated, that unit does not also have to take a Battle-shock test for being Below Half-strength. Regardless of when a unit from your army becomes Battle-shocked, it remains so only until the start of your next Command phase. Destroyed units do not have to take Battle-shock tests, and abilities cannot make a destroyed unit take a Battle-shock test.

Example: An attack with the [LETHAL HITS] ability scores a Critical Hit and so automatically wounds the target. That attack’s Wound roll is automatically successful – no dice is rolled, and so no rules that are triggered by Critical Wounds are triggered.

# Bearer

The bearer of a weapon, Enhancement or item of wargear is the model equipped with it.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# Below Starting Strength

If the number of remaining models in a unit is less than that unit’s Starting Strength, that unit is said to be Below its Starting Strength. If a unit has a Starting Strength of 1, while that model has less than its starting number of wounds remaining, it is said to be Below its Starting Strength.

# Benefit of Cover

Some rules state that a model or unit has the Benefit of Cover even when not within terrain. Such rules apply irrespective of any terrain features that model or unit may be within or behind. Similarly, if a rule only applies while a unit has the Benefit of Cover, that rule will apply to any model or unit under the effects of any rule that gives it the Benefit of Cover (even when not within terrain).

# Best

When determining the ‘best’ characteristic in a unit, compare the values of all the specified characteristics of all the models or weapons in that unit. The best characteristic is the value that all others are either worse than or equal to (see Or Better).

Example: A unit includes one model with a Leadership characteristic of 6+, one with a Leadership characteristic of 7+ and nine with a Leadership characteristic of 8+. The best Leadership characteristic in that unit is therefore 6+.

# Big Guns Never Tire

(Blast weapons and Pistols): Monster and Vehicle units can shoot, and be shot at, even while they are Locked in Combat (Core Rules, page 20).

# See diagram 9

# BIG GUNS NEVER TIRE (BLAST WEAPONS AND PISTOLS)

A. The Vehicle can shoot at this Infantry unit. When resolving each of those attacks, subtract 1 from the Hit roll unless that attack is made with a Pistol. This Infantry unit can shoot at the Vehicle. When resolving each of those attacks, subtract 1 from the Hit roll unless that attack is made with a Pistol. As the Vehicle is within Engagement Range of a friendly unit, Blast weapons cannot target it.

B. When resolving each of those attacks, subtract 1 from the Hit roll. As this target is within Engagement Range, the Vehicle cannot attack it with Blast weapons. This Infantry unit is within Engagement Range of the Vehicle, so is Locked in Combat – its models cannot make ranged attacks except with Pistols (and only the Vehicle can be targeted with those Pistol attacks).# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# Big Guns Never Tire (out-of-phase shooting)

The Big Guns Never Tire rule specifies that it takes effect in the controlling player’s Shooting phase. For units affected by this rule, if they are Locked in Combat, they cannot make use of any rules that let them shoot in other phases, e.g. the Fire Overwatch Stratagem.

# CHARGING

- Charge Move: Move made in the Charge phase as part of a successful charge.
- Charge Distance: The result of a Charge roll is the maximum number of inches each model in a charging unit can move when making its Charge move. This is sometimes referred to as the charge distance.
- Declaring a Charge: When a player declares a charge with a unit, that unit is said to be declaring a charge.
- Charging Unit: A unit that has declared a charge is a charging unit.
- Charging Over Terrain Features with Flying Models: See Moving Over Terrain Features When Flying.
- Has Charged: If a unit makes a Charge move in a turn, until the end of that turn, that unit, and every model in it, is said to have charged.
- Has Been Charged: If a unit was the target of a successful charge during a turn, until the end of that turn, that unit, and every model in it, is said to have been charged.
- Charge Bonus: Bestowed on a unit that makes a Charge move, so that, until the end of the turn, that unit has the Fights First ability. Note that other rules and abilities that trigger when a unit makes a Charge move or in the turn that a unit has charged are not part of the Charge bonus.

# Charging with a Unit

When moving a model from your army within Engagement Range of an enemy model, if that enemy model overhangs its base such that it is not possible to move your model within Engagement Range of that model, until the end of the turn, those models are within Engagement Range of each other while all of the following are true:

- The distance your model could move was sufficient to move it within Engagement Range of the enemy model if there was no overhang.
- You have moved your model as close as possible to the enemy model.
- Any part of one model is within 1" of any part of the other model.

# Closest Model/Unit

When a rule refers to the closest model/unit, this is the closest model/unit to the model/unit using that rule. If two or more are equally close, the controlling player of the model/unit using that rule selects which is the closest for the purposes of that rule.

# Critical Hit

A Critical Hit is scored when a player rolls an unmodified Hit roll of 6 for an attack. Critical Hits are always successful Hit rolls, and can also trigger additional effects as described in certain rules (such effects are often said to be triggered ‘on a Critical Hit’, meaning when a Critical Hit is scored). While resolving attacks using the Fire Overwatch Stratagem, Critical Hits are only ever scored on unmodified Hit rolls of 6.

# Critical Wound

A Critical Wound is scored when a player rolls an unmodified Wound roll of 6 for an attack. Critical Wounds are always successful Wound rolls, and can also trigger additional effects as described in certain rules (such effects are often said to be triggered ‘on a Critical Wound’, meaning when a Critical Wound is scored).

# Considered to Be (dice roll)

See Treated As (dice roll).

# Consolidating (without moving)

When a unit Consolidates, if no models in that unit are actually moved, either because you choose not to move them or because every model is already in base-to-base contact with an enemy model, that unit still counts as having Consolidated, but is not counted as having moved.

# Consolidation Move

A 3" move that, if made, must see that unit end within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units and in Unit Coherency, or, if this is not possible, within range of the closest objective marker and in Unit Coherency. If a unit is able to end a Consolidation move within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units, each model that makes a Consolidation move must end closer to the closest enemy model, and in base-to-base contact with it if possible. Models that are already in base-to-base contact are not moved. If a rule modifies the distance a unit can Consolidate, it modifies the Consolidation move that every model in that unit can make.

# Contested (objective marker)

An objective marker is contested at the end of a phase or turn if both players’ Level of Control over it is the same. At the start of the battle, all objective markers on the battlefield are contested.

# Controlling Player

A unit’s controlling player is the player whose army that unit is part of.

# Control (objective marker)

A player controls an objective marker at the end of any phase or turn in which their Level of Control over it is greater than their opponent’s. At the end of a turn, control of objective markers is determined before any Victory points are scored. See Level of Control.

# Controlled (objective marker)

While a player controls an objective marker it is said to be controlled by that player.

# Count as Having Made a Normal Move

Reserves units always count as having made a Normal move in the turn they are set up on the battlefield. This is simply to clarify that they cannot move further in this phase but have not Remained Stationary; such units have not made a Normal move, however, so their arrival cannot trigger Stratagems or abilities that are used after a unit makes a Normal move.

Similarly, a unit that disembarks from a Transport that made a Normal move this phase also counts as having made a Normal move, but has not made a Normal move, so such a unit’s arrival cannot trigger Stratagems or abilities that are used after a unit makes a Normal move (see Embarked Units and Reserves).

# Counts As (dice roll)

See Treated As (dice roll).

# CP Gained at the Start of a Turn

CP gained at the start of the Command phase as a result of any ability (e.g. The Swarmlord’s Hive Commander ability) count towards the 1CP gained per battle round limit.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# D66

To roll a D66, roll two D6, one after the other – the first result represents ‘tens’ and the second represents ‘units’.

Example: A D66 roll where the first result is a 3 and the second result is a 6 is a result of 36.

# Damage Characteristic

Where a Damage characteristic includes an operator (e.g. a ‘+’, as in D6+1), the value after the operator is part of that Damage characteristic – it is not a modifier.

# Damage Roll

When determining a random Damage characteristic, the dice roll made is called a Damage roll.

# Deep Strike (and Strategic Reserves)

If a unit with the Deep Strike ability arrives from Strategic Reserves, the controlling player can choose for that unit to be set up either using the rules for Strategic Reserves or using the Deep Strike ability. This also applies if a unit with the Deep Strike ability is placed into Strategic Reserves during the battle.

# Deploying Units

When a unit is deployed, it is set up on the battlefield. If a rule specifies that a unit must be deployed wholly within a certain area (e.g. wholly within your deployment zone, or wholly within 6" of a battlefield edge), that unit must be set up wholly within that area (see Within and Wholly Within). If a model is so large that its base cannot physically be set up wholly within such an area, it must be set up so that it is touching your battlefield edge. During a turn in which such a large model is set up on the battlefield, that model’s unit cannot do any of the following: make a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move; Remain Stationary; make any attacks with ranged weapons; declare a charge. Some large models, typically Aircraft, have wings and other parts that extend significantly beyond their base. Such models can overhang a deployment zone if it is not possible to set them up otherwise, but when setting them up, their base must still be wholly within that deployment zone.

# Discard Lowest/Highest Dice Result

If multiple rules instruct a player to discard the lowest/highest dice result for a dice roll, the controlling player decides the order in which those rules are resolved, and each of those rules takes effect one after the other, with one dice from the roll being removed each time. Rules that refer to doubles or triples only take effect after all required dice have been discarded (see Double and Triple).

# Disembarking Large Models

When a unit disembarks from a Transport, it must be set up wholly within 3" of that model. If a disembarking model is so large that it is not possible to set it up wholly within 3" (typically because it is itself larger than 3" in all directions), set that model up with its base within 1" of that Transport’s base (or hull), and not within Engagement Range of any enemy models.

# Do Not Make an Advance Roll Abilities

Abilities that instruct players not to make an Advance roll for a unit, but instead to increase the Move characteristic of models in that unit by a specified amount, cannot be used with other abilities or rules that also instruct players not to make an Advance roll for the unit. In such instances, the controlling player must choose which of those abilities to use.

# Double

When making a dice roll, a double is a roll that includes any two dice of the same result.

# Draw a Line

When instructed to draw a line between two points, draw an imaginary straight line, 1mm wide, between those points. If you are instructed to do so between two models, do so between the closest points of those models’ bases (or hulls).

# DESTROYED

- Destroyed Model: When a model is reduced to 0 wounds, it is destroyed and removed from play.
- Destroyed Unit: When the last model in a unit has been destroyed, that unit is destroyed and removed from play.
- Destroyed By: Some rules only trigger if an enemy model or unit was destroyed by you, or by a model or unit from your army. This means that the enemy model or unit was destroyed by an attack made by a model from your army, or by a mortal wound inflicted as a result of a rule a model from your army is using, or as a result of any other rule a model from your army is using that explicitly states that the enemy model or unit is destroyed. Enemy models or units that are destroyed by any other means are not destroyed by you, or by a model or unit from your army.

# Dice Result (no stated effect)

Some rules are triggered on a particular dice roll. If the dice rolled does not have any corresponding effect stated, nothing happens.

Example: If a rule states ‘roll one D6: on a 2-5, the closest enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound; on a 6, the closest enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds’, and you roll a 1, nothing happens.

# Different Model/Unit

See Other Model/Unit.

Page 19# Warhammer 40K Core Abilities

# DUPLICATED CORE ABILITIES

The Core Rules describe dozens of abilities, including weapon abilities and deployment abilities. These are referred to as Core abilities, and most models, units, weapons or attacks either have one or more of them innately, or can gain them during the battle through other means such as Stratagems, Enhancements or attached Leaders. Regardless of the source, if a model, unit, weapon or attack has multiple instances of the same Core ability, those abilities are not cumulative, and only one instance of that ability can take effect at any one time. If that ability has a number after it (e.g. [SUSTAINED HITS 1], Scouts 6"), the controlling player must choose which instance of that ability to apply each time. Note that multiple instances of the [ANTI-] ability are only considered to be the same if the keyword listed after the word ‘Anti’ is the same (e.g. [ANTI-VEHICLE 4+] and [ANTI-VEHICLE 3+] are considered to be the same ability, but [ANTI-VEHICLE 4+] and [ANTI-INFANTRY 2+] are not).

# Examples

# Example 1

A player’s army includes a unit of Eliminators, who have the Stealth ability. That player selected a Detachment ability that says ‘All units from your army gain the Stealth ability’. The Eliminators do not gain any additional benefit from having this ability a second time, meaning that each time a ranged attack targets that unit, only 1 is subtracted from the Hit roll rather than 2.

# Example 2

A Sternguard Veteran model makes an attack with a Sternguard bolt rifle, which has a Damage characteristic of 1 and the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability. The attacking model is also affected by a Stratagem that says ‘Until the end of the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability’. When resolving attacks with that Sternguard bolt rifle this phase, the controlling player cannot use both instances of [DEVASTATING WOUNDS], meaning that each Critical Wound inflicts 1 mortal wound on the target rather than 2.

# Example 3

A model makes an attack with a heavy bolter, which has the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. The attacking model is also affected by a Stratagem that says ‘Until the end of the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 2] ability’. When resolving attacks with that heavy bolter this phase, the controlling player cannot use both instances of [SUSTAINED HITS]; they must choose which one to use, so choose the more powerful [SUSTAINED HITS 2].

# Eligible Target (no longer eligible)

If a unit that was an eligible target of an attack or charge when it was selected stops being an eligible target for that attack or charge (for example, because a rule enables it to make an out-of-phase move that takes it out of range), the attacking or charging unit can select new targets for those attacks or that charge. See Just After.

# Eligible to Shoot (when equipped with ranged weapons)

Unless a rule specifically states otherwise, units that have shot are no longer eligible to shoot until the start of the next phase.

# Eligible to Shoot (when not equipped with ranged weapons)

Unless a unit Advanced or Fell Back this turn or is Locked in Combat, it is eligible to shoot, even if no models in that unit are equipped with ranged weapons. This means that such units can be selected for any rules that require you to select a unit that is eligible to shoot.

# Embarked Units

Units embarked within a Transport do not count as being on the battlefield for any rules purposes. This means that, unless explicitly stated otherwise, embarked units cannot do anything (e.g. shoot, fight, use abilities, etc.). Similarly, you cannot select an embarked unit as a target for any rules, including Stratagems.

# Embarked Units and Reserves

Units embarked within a Reserves model can disembark in the turn that model is set up. When they do, they cannot be set up within 9" horizontally of one or more enemy units, they count as having made a Normal move (see Count as Having Made a Normal Move), and they cannot declare a charge this turn (unless a rule specifically states otherwise), but they can otherwise act normally in the remainder of the turn.

# End of the Phase/Step

Rules that specify that they take place at the end of a phase/step only take effect after any other rules that would take place in that phase/step have been resolved. This means that it is not possible for a player to make use of any rules that would take place during a phase/step once an end-of-phase rule has taken effect. The next phase/step does not start until after all such rules have been resolved (for rules used at the end of the Command phase, see Rules Used at the End of the Command Phase).

# Enhancements (multi-model Character units)

When you give an Enhancement to a Character unit from your army, if that Character unit contains more than one model, you must specify which Character model in that unit is the bearer.

# Fast Dice Rolling and Rules That Allow One Re-roll

When a rule allows you to re-roll one roll or saving throw out of multiple rolls or saving throws for a unit, if you are using fast dice rolling, you can roll multiple rolls or saving throws at once and then decide which of those to re-roll.

# Feel No Pain

For each wound a model with the Feel No Pain ability would lose, the controlling player rolls one D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the number listed at the end of that ability, that wound is not lost.

Example: An attack with a Damage characteristic of 2 is allocated to a model with the Feel No Pain 5+ ability, and the subsequent saving throw is not successful, so that attack inflicts two points of damage. That model’s controlling player therefore rolls two D6, rolling a 1 and a 6. As the 6 exceeds the requirement of that model’s Feel No Pain 5+ ability, one point of damage is ignored and that model only loses one wound.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# Fight on Death

Some rules enable models to fight after they have been destroyed, before being removed from play, following the normal fight sequence (Core Rules, page 33). When doing so, those models may Pile In (following all restrictions of Unit Coherency) and then make melee attacks, selecting which weapons they will make attacks with and the targets for those attacks, before resolving those attacks. A model under the effect of more than one such rule can only fight once after it has been destroyed. ‘Fight-on-death’ rules are always resolved before the attacking unit (i.e. the unit that destroyed the model that has that rule) Consolidates, and before any other rules are triggered by the destruction of that model (e.g. Deadly Demise). While making attacks due to a fight-on-death rule, the destroyed model is assumed to have 1 wound remaining unless otherwise stated. After a model has made its fight-on-death attacks, any other rules that are triggered by the destruction of that model are then triggered, and it is then removed from play – it does not Consolidate. If more than one model from a unit is under the effect of a fight-on-death rule, each of those models fights at the same time. Note that, at the time a model fights on death, it is destroyed, which may be important when determining whether that model’s unit is below its Starting Strength/Below Half-strength.

# Fight

When a unit fights, models in that unit Pile In, make attacks and Consolidate.

# Fighting with Individual Models

Normally units are selected to fight, but some rules specify that only one model in a unit can fight (or can fight again). In such instances:

# Ground Level

Some rules refer to models being at ‘ground level’ for the purposes of being targeted (e.g. Plunging Fire) or for determining whether models can be set up on higher levels of terrain features. A model that is in contact with the battlefield surface (within the footprint of a terrain feature or otherwise) is said to be at ground level. If you are using terrain features with an integral base or textured ground-floor area models can be placed upon, such areas are also considered to be ground level.

# Highest Dice Result

If a rule refers to the highest dice result and a dice roll involves multiple dice, if more than one of those dice have the same value, and that value is the highest, the active player must select one of those dice to be the highest dice result.

# Horizontal/Vertical Distances

Some rules state that the distance involved should be measured horizontally or vertically. When resolving such rules, do not measure ‘diagonally’. See diagrams 10 and 11.

# Hull

When measuring to and from Vehicles (excluding Walker models that have a base) and models that do not have a base, measure to and from the hull, which means any part of that model (or its base, if it has one) that is closest to the point being measured from or to. Note that this may not correspond literally with the area on a vehicle usually termed the hull (see Vehicles with Bases).

# Fight Sequence

- That model can make a Pile-in move, but must end that move in Unit Coherency.
- That model then makes a number of attacks with its melee weapons, as specified in the Make Melee Attacks step of the fight sequence (Core Rules, page 33).
- That model can then make a Consolidation move, but must end that move in Unit Coherency.

# Finished Making its Attacks

When all of an attacking unit’s attacks have been resolved, it has finished making its attacks.

# Firing Model/Unit

When resolving a ranged attack, the model/unit making the attack is the firing model/unit.

# Fly

If a unit’s datasheet has the Fly keyword, that unit is said to be able to Fly. When it makes a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move, its models can be moved over enemy models as if they were not there. Note this also means that Monster and Vehicle models that can Fly can be moved over other Monster and Vehicle models when making such a move. When such a model starts or ends a move on a terrain feature, instead of measuring the path it has moved across the battlefield, you instead measure its path ‘through the air’ (see Moving Over Terrain Features When Flying).

# Full Wounds Remaining

A model has its full wounds remaining if it has the same number of wounds remaining as its Wounds characteristic.

# Gaining CP From Mission Cards

When playing a mission that gives a player one or more CP for discarding Secondary Mission cards, that CP counts towards the limit on the number of CP that player can gain that battle round.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules

# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules

# Just After

If a rule is triggered ‘just after’ something has happened, it is resolved before anything else happens. For example, if a rule is triggered ‘just after’ a unit selects targets for its attacks, that rule is resolved before those attacks are resolved. The triggering of such rules can therefore interrupt normal sequences such as the attack sequence or the charge sequence. See Eligible Target (no longer eligible).

# Keywords

- If a rule specifies that it applies to a model/unit with a Keyword, it only applies to a model/unit with that keyword on its datasheet.
- If a rule specifies that it applies to ‘non-Keyword’ models/units, it only applies to models/units that do not have that keyword. For example, if a rule applies to non-Vehicle units, it only applies to units that do not have the Vehicle keyword.
- Some units can contain models that have different keywords. While this is the case, such a unit is considered to have all of the keywords of all of its models, and so is affected by any rule that applies to units with any of those keywords. Remember that attacks are made against units, not models.
- Example: An Attached unit contains a Leader model with the Psyker keyword. While that Leader is part of that unit, the entire unit is considered to have the Psyker keyword. If that unit is attacked by a weapon with the [ANTI-PSYKER 4+] ability, any unmodified Wound roll of 4+ made against that unit scores a Critical Wound, even if the attack itself is not allocated to that Leader model.

If a rule only applies to models with a specific keyword, then it instead only applies to models in such a unit that have the correct keyword.
- A Keyword Detachment is a Detachment that only contains models that have that keyword (excluding any models that specify that they do not prevent a Detachment from gaining its Detachment rules).
- A rule with a comma-separated list of keywords, or two keywords separated by the word ‘or’ (e.g. ‘an Immortals, Deathmarks or Lychguard unit’) refers to a model/unit that has any one of those keywords.
- A rule with multiple adjacent keywords (e.g. ‘an Aeldari Guardians unit’) only refers to a model/unit that has all of those keywords.

# Leadership Test

Roll 2D6 and if the total is greater than or equal to the best Leadership characteristic in that unit, the test is passed. Otherwise, the test is failed.

# Lethal Hits (and Devastating Wounds)

See Automatically Wounds.

# Lethal Hits (and Sustained Hits)

See Additional Hits.

# Level of Control

A player’s Level of Control over an objective marker is determined by summing the Objective Control characteristics of all of their models that are within range of it.

# Distances Between Models Horizontal and Vertical

Measured diagonally, these two models are 5" apart. However, for the purposes of measuring distance, they are 3" apart horizontally and 4" apart vertically.

|Diagonal Distance|Horizontal Distance|Vertical Distance|
|---|---|---|
|5"|3"|4"|# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# 11 HORIZONTAL DISTANCE AND DEEP STRIKE

The Terminator is arriving using the Deep Strike ability. It cannot be set up within 9" horizontally of any enemy models, such as the Tyranid Prime (the diagonal and vertical distances are irrelevant).

9"

# Locked in Combat

While a unit is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units, it is said to be Locked in Combat. Units that are Locked in Combat are not eligible to shoot and cannot be selected as the target of a ranged attack. Monster and Vehicle units are exceptions to this (see Big Guns Never Tire).

# Model’s/Unit’s Phase

When a rule refers to a model’s/unit’s phase (e.g. ‘this model’s Command phase’), it refers to the relevant phase of that model’s/unit’s controlling player.

# Models Without Bases

See Hull.

# Lowest Dice Result

If a rule refers to the lowest dice result and a dice roll involves multiple dice, if more than one of those dice have the same value, and that value is the lowest, the active player must select one of those dice to be the lowest dice result.

# Measuring to a Destroyed Model

When a player has to measure the distance to a destroyed model, that player can measure to any point occupied by that model’s base (or any part of that model if it does not have a base or is a Vehicle, excluding Walker models that have a base) before it was destroyed.

# Measuring to a Destroyed Unit

When a player has to measure the distance to a destroyed unit, they measure to the last model destroyed in that unit (see Measuring to a Destroyed Model).

# Mortal Wounds

Saving throws (of any kind) cannot be made against damage inflicted by mortal wounds, although rules that allow models to ignore wounds (e.g. Feel No Pain) can be used. If an attacking unit inflicts a mixture of mortal wounds and normal damage, resolve all of the attacking unit’s normal damage first.

# Moving Over Models

Some models have a rule that enables them to ‘move over models’, or ‘move over models as if they were not there’ when making a move. When moving a model with such a rule, it can be moved within Engagement Range of enemy models, but it cannot end a move on top of another model, it cannot end a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move within Engagement Range of any enemy models, and it can only end a Charge move within Engagement Range of units it declared a charge against that phase.

# Minimum Move

Aircraft models have a move characteristic of 20+". This is the minimum distance the model must move in its Movement phase and all parts of the model’s base must end the move at least this far away from where they started.

# Mixed Toughness

See Unit’s Toughness Characteristic.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# Moving Over Terrain Features When Flying

Models that can Fly can move over intervening terrain features when making a Normal, Advance, Fall Back or Charge move. When doing so, you must measure the path through the air.

See diagrams 12 and 13

# Moving within Engagement Range

If a unit is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy models, it cannot perform any type of Move other than a Fall Back, Pile-in or Consolidation move.

# Null Characteristics

If a model has a Strength or Leadership characteristic of ‘-’ and that characteristic is required to resolve a rule, use the model’s Toughness characteristic instead. Note that the substituted characteristic cannot be modified.

# Objective Marker (within range of)

A model is within range of an objective marker if it is within 3" horizontally and 5" vertically of that objective marker. When measuring distances to an objective marker, measure to the closest point of that objective marker.

# Nearest

See Closest Model/Unit.

# Negative Modifier

A modifier that reduces or worsens a characteristic, dice roll or other rule. See Modifiers.

# No Man’s Land

Any part of the battlefield that is not in either player’s deployment zone is called No Man’s Land.

# Normal Damage

Damage inflicted on a model as a result of a weapon’s Damage characteristic, rather than by other means such as mortal wounds.

# Not Been Selected to Shoot or Fight This Phase

This phrasing is used in several rules – typically Stratagems that can be used in the Shooting or Fight phase. When using such rules, the reference to ‘shoot’ only applies in the Shooting phase, and the reference to ‘fight’ only applies in the Fight phase. For example, you cannot use such a rule on a unit in the Shooting phase because that unit hasn’t been selected to fight that phase.

# Objective Secured

Various abilities allow you to retain control of an objective marker even if you have no models within range of it (for example, the Objective Secured ability of Intercessor Squads). Regardless of how these rules are worded, control of objective markers is determined at the end of each phase and turn (see Core Rules Errata), so while you retain control of an objective marker affected by this ability even if you have no models within range of it, at the end of a phase or turn your opponent can gain control of that objective marker if their Level of Control over it is greater than yours.

# One Shot

If a model is equipped with more than one of the same weapon with the [ONE SHOT] ability (e.g. 2 hunter-killer missiles), that model can shoot with each of those weapons once per battle. One Shot weapons cannot be used with the Firing Deck ability. Each time a destroyed model is returned to a unit, any [ONE SHOT] weapons equipped by that model that were shot before they were destroyed have still been shot. Each time a new unit is added to an army, any [ONE SHOT] weapons those models are equipped with have not been shot.

# Diagram 12: Moving Over Terrain ‘Through the Air’ When Flying

This model can Fly. When moving it over terrain features that are greater than 2" in height (all models can move freely over terrain features that are 2" or less in height), you measure the shortest path ‘through the air’ required to move over that terrain feature. In this example, the model has moved a total of 16".

# Moving Over Uneven Terrain Features

# ‘Through the Air’ When Flying

These models can Fly and are all moving over terrain that is not uniform in height. The distance moved is the path the model takes ‘through the air’, and this must be sufficient for the model’s base to pass through while remaining flat and parallel to the battlefield surface. As such, Model A’s base is too wide to fit through the gap in front of it, so it must move up high enough for its whole base to be able to clear the height of the terrain in front of it. Model B needs to move over a higher part in order to clear the height of the terrain feature at a point where the base will fit, while Model C can move over a shorter part of this terrain.

A

B

C

To finish moving over the terrain, the models move any distance required across the terrain then the remainder of the distance ‘through the air’ to the battlefield surface, ensuring that no part of this move exceeds the model’s maximum Move characteristic and the unit is in Unit Coherency. If a model cannot finish this move due to not having enough movement or without breaking Unit Coherency, the move cannot be made. Note that it may be possible to place one or more models on horizontal parts of the terrain feature while others are placed on the battlefield surface, and this can be done so long as the unit remains in coherency.

C# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# Or Better

When referring to the value of an invulnerable save, the Feel No Pain ability, or a characteristic preceding a plus sign, a better value is one with a lower number before the plus sign. For example, a WS characteristic of 2+ is better than a WS characteristic of 3+. When referring to the value of an AP characteristic, a better value is one with a higher number after the minus sign (note that an AP characteristic of 0 can be considered to be an AP characteristic of -0 for such purposes). When referring to any other characteristic, a better value is one with a higher number. For example, a Toughness characteristic of 5 is better than a Toughness characteristic of 4.

# Or Worse

When referring to the value of an invulnerable save, the Feel No Pain ability, or a characteristic preceding a plus sign, a worse value is one with a higher number before the plus sign. For example, a WS characteristic of 3+ is worse than a WS characteristic of 2+. When referring to the value of an AP characteristic, a worse value is one with a lower number after the minus sign (note that an AP characteristic of 0 can be considered to be an AP characteristic of -0 for such purposes). When referring to any other characteristic, a worse value is one with a lower value. For example, a Toughness characteristic of 4 is worse than a Toughness characteristic of 5.

# Other Model/Unit

When a rule refers to models or units ‘other’ than the one with that rule (or one already mentioned by that rule), it means a different model or unit to that original one. Note that different instances of the same datasheet are still considered to be ‘other’ units.

# Out-of-phase Rules

Some rules allow a model or unit to move, shoot, charge or fight outside of the normal turn sequence. For example, the Fire Overwatch Stratagem enables a unit to shoot in the opponent’s turn as if it were your Shooting phase. When using out-of-phase rules to perform an action as if it were one of your phases, you cannot use any other rules that are normally triggered in that phase.

# Piles In

When an eligible unit is selected to fight, it first Piles In and its models can make a Pile-in move. If no models in that unit are actually moved because every model is already in base-to-base contact with an enemy model, the unit still counts as having Piled In for the purposes of any rules that are triggered when a unit Piles In or ends a Pile-in move, but do not count as having moved.

# PRIORITY OF RULES

While playing Warhammer 40,000, you will occasionally find that two rules are in direct conflict and so cannot both be applied. In these cases, check below to see if one of those rules has priority over the other.

# Attacker’s Priority

While making attacks, you will occasionally find that two rules cannot both apply – for example, when an attacking model with an ability enabling its attacks to successfully wound on a 2+ targets a unit that has an ability stating it can only be wounded on a 4+. In such cases, the attacking model’s rules take priority.

# Reinforcement Priority

While setting up Reinforcement units, you will occasionally find that two rules cannot both apply – for example, when a unit is arriving using the Deep Strike ability (which allows it to be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from all enemy units) but an enemy unit has a rule that prevents enemy Reinforcement units from being set up within 12". In such cases, rules limiting the placement of Reinforcement units take priority over rules that state where Reinforcement units can be placed.

# Psychic Attacks

Any attack made with a weapon that has the [PSYCHIC] ability is a Psychic Attack. Any mortal wounds inflicted by an ability that has the ‘Psychic’ tag are also Psychic Attacks.

# Psychic Weapons and Abilities

Weapons with [PSYCHIC] in their profile are known as Psychic weapons. Abilities tagged with the word ‘Psychic’ are known as Psychic abilities. Generally speaking, Psychic weapons and abilities are used by Psykers, but the absence of the Psyker keyword does not prevent a model from using any Psychic weapons or abilities it has.

# Pile-in Move

A 3" move that, if made, must result in the unit being in Unit Coherency and within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units. Each model that makes a Pile-in move must end closer to the closest enemy model, and in base-to-base contact with it if possible. Models that are already in base-to-base contact are not moved. If a rule modifies the distance a unit can Pile-in, it modifies the Pile-in move that every model in that unit can make.

# Points Total

The combined points values of all units from a player’s army.

# Positive Modifier

A modifier that improves or makes a characteristic, dice roll or other rule better (see Modifiers).# Warhammer 40K Rules


# Repositioned Units

Some rules enable units to be repositioned by removing them from the battlefield then setting them back up on the battlefield. Units that use such rules are known as repositioned units, and the points below always apply to them in addition to any other rules that can affect that unit, such as where they can or cannot be set up. Note that units that are using rules to embark within or disembark from Transports are not repositioned units.

# Replacement Units

Some rules enable units to be removed from the battlefield and replaced with a new, full-strength unit. In such cases, the following points apply:

1. If used in the Movement phase, such rules can be used on units that arrived as Reinforcements this phase, and can be used on units that have already been selected to move this phase.
2. Rules that are triggered by or apply to Reserves units or units that are ‘set up on the battlefield as Reinforcements’ are also triggered by and apply to a repositioned unit when it is set back up.
3. A repositioned unit that Advanced or Fell Back in the phase in which it is set back up has still Advanced or Fallen Back in that phase. Otherwise, a repositioned unit counts as having made a Normal move in the phase in which it is set back up.
4. If a repositioned unit is Below Half-strength and it was not on the battlefield during your Command phase, it must take a Battle-shock test as if it were your Command phase after it has been set back up.
5. If a unit is below its Starting Strength when it is removed from the battlefield to be repositioned, destroyed models are not returned to that unit when it is set back up. Likewise, wounded models in that unit do not regain any lost wounds when they are set back up.
6. When a unit is removed from the battlefield to be repositioned, any rules affecting it for a specified duration or under specified circumstances continue to affect it while that duration/those circumstances apply. For example, a unit that was within range of an Aura ability when it was removed would no longer be affected by that Aura ability if it is set back up beyond that Aura ability’s range, whereas a unit that was Battle-shocked when it was removed would still be Battle-shocked until the start of your next Command phase.
7. When a repositioned unit is being set up on the battlefield, if there are areas of the battlefield that models cannot be set up within (e.g. there is a mission rule stating that ‘when a player’s Reserves or Strategic Reserves units are set up on the battlefield, they cannot be set up within range of an objective marker that is either in No Man’s Land or their opponent’s deployment zone’, or there are one or more enemy units on the battlefield that have a rule such as ‘enemy units that are set up on the battlefield as Reinforcements cannot be set up within 12" of this unit’), the models in that repositioned unit cannot be set up within those areas.

# Re-rolls

- A dice can never be re-rolled more than once.
- When re-rolling a dice roll that involves several dice (e.g. 2D6), all of the dice involved in that roll must be re-rolled.
- If a rule allows you to re-roll specific dice results, only those dice can be re-rolled.
- If a rule allows you to re-roll a specific dice result, but the result is obtained by halving a D6 (such as when rolling a D3), you must use the value of the halved roll to determine if it can be re-rolled, not the value of the original D6. For example, if a rule allows you to re-roll results of 1, and you roll a D3, you can re-roll if the D6 roll was a 1 or 2 (i.e. a D3 result of 1).
- Modifiers are applied after any applicable re-rolls of a dice roll have been made.
- If a rule allows you to re-roll more than one type of roll (e.g. ‘You can re-roll the Hit roll and you can re-roll the Wound roll’), you can choose to re-roll any or all of the specified rolls – you do not have to choose between re-rolling either all of them or none of them.
- A re-roll is still considered to be a roll and, as such, any rules that can be triggered by a dice roll can also be triggered by a re-roll.

# Returning Models to a Unit

Some rules resurrect or return models to their unit. Such models are added to their unit (see Adding Models to a Unit) along with any wargear and Enhancements they started the battle with. Such rules can never expand a unit beyond its Starting Strength; any additional models that would be returned beyond that point are ignored (the only exception to this is the Split ability of Pink Horrors and Blue Horrors). If such a rule returns models to a unit in the same phase they were destroyed, then for the purposes of allocating attacks later in the same phase, such models do not count as having lost any wounds or as already having had any attacks allocated to them this phase. If a Leader model is destroyed and subsequently returned to the battlefield, and the Bodyguard unit they were attached to is on the battlefield, they must be returned to that unit to form an Attached unit once more (otherwise, they are returned as a separate unit).

# Regaining Wounds

When a model regains a number of wounds, it regains up to that number of lost wounds. This cannot cause the model to have more wounds remaining than it started the battle with.

# Reinforcements/Reinforcement Units

See Reserves Units.

# Reserves Units

Any unit that starts the battle in a location other than the battlefield, and is not embarked within a Transport that starts the battle on the battlefield, is considered to be a Reserves unit. When a Reserves unit is set up on the battlefield, it counts as having made a Normal move that phase (see Count as Having Made a Normal Move). Any Reserves units that have not been set up on the battlefield by the end of the battle count as destroyed. Units can still use rules and abilities while in Reserves.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# Resolving an Attack

When the attack sequence for a single attack has ended, that attack has been resolved.

# Resolved Its Attacks

When an attacking unit has finished making all of its attacks, it is said to have resolved all of its attacks.

# Scores a Wound

An attack is said to have scored a wound if it successfully wounds the target and the Allocate Attack step of the attack sequence is reached, even if that attack is subsequently saved by a successful saving throw, or if the damage inflicted by that attack is subsequently ignored by an ability such as Feel No Pain.

# Remained Stationary

Any units from your army that were on the battlefield at the start of your Movement phase and were not selected to move in the Move Units step of that phase (or which you forgot to select to move) are assumed to have Remained Stationary that phase.

# Round Bases

Some rules refer to round bases. A round base is one whose footprint is circular (as opposed to an oval base, whose footprint is an oval).

# Ruins (and Visibility)

The diagrams below illustrate how visibility can be affected when units are within, wholly within or behind Ruins. For Vehicles (excluding Walker models that have a base) or models without bases, every part of the model and its base (if it has one) is used for determining if it is not within, within or wholly within a Ruin. For all other models, the model’s base is used to determine if it is not within, within or wholly within a Ruin. For the purposes of visibility into or through a Ruin, visibility to and from such a model that overhangs its base is determined only by its base and parts of that model that do not overhang its base.

Example: For a Vehicle model (excluding Walker models that have a base) to be wholly within a Ruin, every part of that Vehicle model must be wholly within that Ruin. For a Monster model to be wholly within a Ruin, that model’s base must be wholly within that Ruin, regardless of the other parts of that model.

See diagrams 14, 15 and 16

# Rules That Are Triggered after Selecting a Target

See Eligible Target (no longer eligible) and Just After.

# Rules Used at the End of the Command Phase

While most rules used in the Command phase have to be used in the Command step of that phase, if a rule explicitly specifies that it takes effect at the end of the Command phase, then that rule takes effect at the end of the Battle-shock step of the phase, instead of in the Command step.

# Rules with Multiple Conditions and Effects

Some rules have multiple conditions, with the second, more specific condition conferring an improved rule, either instead of the first condition’s rule or as well as it (e.g. Lokhust Destroyers’ Hard-wired for Destruction ability or the Orks Bigger Shells For Bigger Gitz Stratagem). Such rules require both the first condition and the second condition to be satisfied for the improved rule to apply.

Example: The Hard-wired for Destruction ability reads: ‘Each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack that targets the closest eligible target, re-roll a Hit roll of 1. If the target of that attack is within range of an objective marker your opponent controls, you can re-roll the Hit roll instead.’ To be able to re-roll the Hit roll, the target must be both within range of an objective marker your opponent controls and be the closest eligible target.

# Scouts (with different values)

If every model in an Attached unit has the Scouts ability, but the distance listed in that ability varies between models, that unit can still make its ‘Scout move’, but can only do so up to the shortest of those distances. For example, a unit containing some models with the Scouts 6" ability and some models with the Scouts 9" ability can only make a Scout move of up to 6".

# Set Up on the Battlefield

When models, objective markers and terrain features are placed onto the battlefield from a place other than the battlefield, they are said to be set up on the battlefield. Models must be set up in Unit Coherency when they are set up on the battlefield. If, for any reason, a model cannot be set up on the battlefield when instructed to do so, that model is destroyed, but does not trigger any rules that are triggered when a model is destroyed (e.g. Deadly Demise).

# Shoot on Death

Some rules enable a model to shoot after it has been destroyed, before being removed from play. A model under the effect of more than one ‘shoot-on-death’ rule can only shoot once after it has been destroyed, regardless of how many such rules may apply to it. Shoot-on-death rules are always resolved before any other rules that are triggered when a model is destroyed (e.g. Deadly Demise). When making attacks due to a shoot-on-death rule, the destroyed model’s unit always counts as having made a Normal move that turn and, unless otherwise stated, the destroyed model counts as having 1 wound remaining. Shoot-on-death rules are also out-of-phase rules (see Out-of-phase Rules).

# Shoot Again

Some rules allow units (or sometimes models or weapons) to shoot again in your Shooting phase, or shoot ‘as if it were your Shooting phase’. Such rules cannot be used on a unit unless it is eligible to shoot when that rule is used. When a unit shoots again, any models in that unit that have already shot in that phase with any of the weapons they are equipped with can shoot those weapons one additional time. When a model shoots again, it can shoot with any weapons it is equipped with that it has already shot with that phase one additional time. When a model can shoot with a specific weapon again, that model can shoot with it one additional time, even if it has already shot with it that phase. If a rule allows a unit, model or weapon to shoot again, then it must resolve its original ranged attacks before shooting again.

Example: A Hellblaster model uses its For the Chapter! ability after being destroyed, allowing it to shoot one additional time. When it does, that model follows the normal attack sequence for its ranged weapons, making attacks and rolling to hit and wound as normal.

# Shot

When all of the attacks made with a ranged weapon have been resolved, that weapon has shot. When all of a model’s ranged weapons have shot, that model has shot. When all models in a unit that are making ranged attacks have resolved all of those attacks, that unit has shot (see Resolved Its Attacks). If a unit was selected to shoot and none of the models in it make any attacks, it is not considered to have shot.

# Saved

Attacks or damage are said to have been saved if any kind of saving throw made as a result has been successful in preventing a model from suffering damage.

# Single Target (model)

When a model attacks with one or more ranged weapons, if all of the attacks made with those ranged weapons target the same unit, that model is said to be shooting at a single target.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# Visibility Rules

# 14 MODEL NOT WITHIN RUINS

|A|The Vehicle cannot see this Infantry unit, and this Infantry unit cannot see the Vehicle.|
|---|---|
|B|This Infantry unit is wholly within the ruins, so can be seen normally and can see out of it normally.|
|C|The Vehicle can see this Infantry unit, and this unit can see the Vehicle.|

# 15 MODEL PARTIALLY WITHIN RUINS

|A|The Vehicle cannot see this Infantry unit because the Vehicle is not Towering and it is not wholly within the ruins, but as models can see into ruins normally, this Infantry unit can see the Vehicle.|
|---|---|
|B|The Vehicle can see this Infantry unit because this Infantry unit is wholly within the ruins and visible. This Infantry unit is wholly within the ruins, so can see out normally.|
|C|The Vehicle can still see this Infantry unit, and this Infantry unit can see the Vehicle. The Vehicle cannot see targets on the other side of the ruins, but all other normal visibility rules apply.|# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# 16 MODEL WHOLLY WITHIN RUINS

A The Vehicle can see this Infantry unit as the Vehicle is wholly within the ruins, and this Infantry unit can see the Vehicle, following the normal rules for visibility.

B This unit and the Vehicle are both wholly within the ruins, so can see and be seen normally.

C The Vehicle can see this Infantry unit, and this Infantry unit can see the Vehicle, following the normal rules for visibility.

# Single Target (unit)

When a unit is selected to shoot, if all of the models in that unit that are making attacks target the same unit with all of those attacks, the attacking unit is said to be shooting at a single target.

# Splitting Units

Some abilities allow you to split units into two smaller units before the battle (e.g. the Transport ability of Drukhari Venoms). When using such abilities, the same models can only be subdivided in this way once (i.e. those smaller units cannot themselves be split further). If a rule is used to split a unit into multiple units before the battle, the Starting Strength of each individual unit is changed to be equal to the number of models in that unit.

# Start of the battle round/turn/phase

If a rule is triggered at the start of the battle round/turn/phase, it is triggered at the start of every battle round/turn/phase.

Example: If a rule is triggered ‘At the start of the Command phase’, it means ‘At the start of each player’s Command phase’.

# Starting Strength

A unit’s Starting Strength is the number of models in it at the point that it is added to your army.

# Stratagem Label

A Stratagem’s labels are written beneath its title and can include: Battle Tactic; Epic Deed, Strategic Ploy; Wargear. A Stratagem can have more than one label; for example, a Stratagem with ‘Rad-Cohort – Wargear Stratagem’ has both the Rad-Cohort and Wargear labels.

# Suffers Damage

If an attack reaches the Inflict Damage step of the attack sequence, the model that attack was allocated to is said to have suffered damage, even if that model subsequently uses a rule to ignore the wounds inflicted or it uses a rule that means those wounds are not lost.

# Table Quarter

One even quarter of the battlefield. If a rule instructs you to divide the battlefield into four even quarters, it should be divided up using two lines that both pass through the centre of the battlefield, one of which runs parallel to one battlefield edge and the other running perpendicular to the same battlefield edge. When measuring the distance to a table quarter, only measure the horizontal distance.

# Target (as part of an ability)

Whenever an ability triggers as a result of a condition being met (e.g. [BLAST]), the condition triggering that ability is checked at the time the target of that attack is selected, before any models in that unit make any attacks. If the condition triggering that ability is not met, that ability will not take effect for any attacks in that shooting or fight sequence.

Example: A unit of Flayed Ones selects a unit of 10 Flesh Hounds as the target of its melee attacks. As the Flesh Hounds are not Below Half-strength when selected as the target of those attacks, none of the Flayed Ones’ attacks will have the Flesh Hunger ability.

# Target (of an attack)

When resolving an attack, the target unit of that attack is also known as the target.

# Target (of a charge)

When a player declares a charge with a unit, the targets of that charge are each said to have been declared as a target of a charge.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# The Turn/The Phase

If a rule triggers during ‘the turn’ or ‘the phase’ instead of during ‘your turn’, ‘your phase’, ‘your opponent’s turn’ or ‘your opponent’s phase’, that rule triggers in both players’ turn/phase.

Example: If a rule states ‘At the end of the Movement phase, this model regains 1 lost wound’, that rule triggers at the end of your Movement phase and at the end of your opponent’s Movement phase.

# Token

Tokens are gaming aids that some rules instruct you to place next to model/unit to remind you and your opponent that a model/unit either has a limited-use ability or is under the effects of a particular rule. Tokens are not counted as models for any purposes (even if they are being represented by a model). If another model needs to move into the space occupied by a token, reposition the token to allow that move to be made.

# Treated As (dice roll)

When a dice result is ‘treated as’ another value, any rules that would take effect if that value had been rolled take effect.

# Triple

When making a dice roll, a triple is a roll that includes any three dice of the same result.

# Unit Champion

Some rules refer to Unit Champions. This term refers to the differently named model in some units that represents their thematic leader. For example, an Intercessor Sergeant is the Unit Champion in an Intercessor Squad. Note that not all units have a Unit Champion, while other units may have multiple such models (e.g. Runtherds in a Gretchin unit). In the case of multiples, the controlling player must nominate one of those models to be the Unit Champion before the battle. Unit Champions have no relevance to the Leader ability.

# Unit’s Engagement Range

A unit’s Engagement Range is the area covered by the Engagement Range of all models in that unit.

# Unit’s Equipment

When a rule refers to a unit’s equipment, it refers to all of the wargear equipped by models in that unit.

# Unit’s Leadership Characteristic

This is the value of the best Leadership characteristic amongst all models in a unit.

# Unit’s Phase

A unit’s phase is the same as the controlling player’s phase. For example, a unit’s Movement phase is the controlling player’s Movement phase.

# Unit’s Save Characteristic

If a rule refers to a unit’s Save characteristic, it refers to the most common Save characteristic amongst models in that unit. If two different Save characteristics are equally common amongst models in a unit, that unit’s controlling player decides which of those characteristics is considered that unit’s Save characteristic for the purposes of such a rule. When a rule modifies a unit’s Save characteristic, it modifies the Save characteristic of every model in that unit.

# Unit’s Toughness Characteristic

If an Attached unit contains models with different Toughness characteristics, for the purpose of determining that unit’s Toughness characteristic, use the highest Toughness characteristic amongst that unit’s Bodyguard models. If a non-Attached unit contains models with different Toughness characteristics, for the purpose of determining that unit’s Toughness characteristic, use the highest Toughness characteristic amongst all of that unit’s models. In either case, when resolving attacks against such a unit, determine that unit’s Toughness characteristic when it is selected as a target.

# Vehicles with Bases

When measuring to and from Vehicles with bases (excluding Aircraft and Walkers) always measure to and from the closest part of the model for all rules purposes (i.e. measure to or from its base or its hull, whichever is closest), with the following exceptions:

- When a model ends a move within Engagement Range of one or more Vehicles with bases (excluding Aircraft and Walkers), it is considered to be in base-to-base contact with that Vehicle or those Vehicles while it is within 0" horizontally and 5" vertically of any part of those Vehicle models.
- When a Vehicle with a base (excluding Aircraft and Walkers) ends a move within Engagement Range of one or more models, it is considered to be in base-to-base contact with those models while it is within 0" horizontally and 5" vertically of those models.
- A unit can embark within a friendly Transport with a base after that unit ends a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move wholly within 3" horizontally and 5" vertically of any part of that Transport.
- When a unit disembarks from a Transport with a base, set it up so that it is wholly within 3" horizontally and 5" vertically of any part of that Transport model and not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.

# Visibility

- Model/Unit Visible: If any part of another model can be seen from any part of the observing model, that other model is visible to it. If one model in a unit is visible, then the unit is said to be visible to the observing model.
- Model Fully Visible: If every part of another model that is facing the observing model can be seen from any part of the observing model then that other model is said to be fully visible to the observing model i.e. the observing model has a line of sight to all parts of the other model that are facing it, without any other models or terrain features blocking any part of it. If a model is fully visible to every model in an observing unit, then that model is fully visible to the observing unit.
- Unit Fully Visible: If every model in a unit is fully visible to an observing model, then that unit is fully visible to the observing model. If every model in a unit is fully visible to every model in an observing unit, then that unit is fully visible to the observing unit. For the purposes of determining if an enemy unit is fully visible, a model can also see through other models in its own unit and through other models in the unit it is looking at.# Warhammer 40K - Within and Wholly Within

# Within and Wholly Within

# Definitions

- Within: If a rule says it applies ‘within’ a specified distance, it applies at any distance that is not more than that distance. For example, within 1" means any distance that is not more than 1" away.
- Model/Unit Within: A model is within a specified distance if any part of its base (or hull) is within that distance. A unit is within a specified distance if one or more of its models are within that distance.
- Model/Unit Wholly Within: A model is wholly within a specified distance if every part of its base (or hull) is within that distance. For example, a model is wholly within a terrain feature such as Woods or Ruins if no part of its base (or hull) extends beyond the footprint of that terrain feature. A unit is wholly within a specified distance if every model in that unit is wholly within that distance.

# Examples

A

C

B

# Example A

One model in this unit is within the ruin. The unit is therefore within the ruin, but not wholly within it.

# Example B

Every model in this unit is wholly within the ruin. The unit is therefore wholly within the ruin.

# Example C

Four models in this unit are wholly within the ruin, and one model is only within the ruin. The unit is therefore within the ruin, but not wholly within it.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Rules


# Warlord (must be/cannot be)

When selecting your Warlord, if more than one model from your army has a rule that states it must be your Warlord, you must select which of those models will be your Warlord. If one rule states that a model must be your Warlord and another rule states that that model cannot be your Warlord, the rule that prohibits that model from being your Warlord takes precedence.

# When

If a rule states that it takes place when a certain trigger occurs, unless otherwise stated, that rule takes effect before any others.

# While This Model is Leading a Unit

These rules only apply while the model with that rule is part of an Attached unit, and otherwise have no effect. While a model with such a rule is part of an Attached unit, it will also benefit from its own rule. If an Attached unit contains more than one model with such a rule, both models are considered to be leading that Attached unit, and so all such rules apply. Such rules cease to apply if that unit ceases to be an Attached unit (such as when the last Bodyguard model in that unit is destroyed) – if this is as the result of an enemy unit’s attacks, all ‘while this model is leading a unit…’ rules cease to apply after the attacking unit’s attacks have been resolved.

# With the ‘X’ Ability

Some rules affect or require you to select a model or unit with a particular ability. When resolving such rules, any numbers following the ability are irrelevant when determining if the rule affects that model or unit.

Example: If a rule instructs you to select a model from your army with the Deadly Demise ability, you could select a model with the Deadly Demise 1, Deadly Demise D3 or Deadly Demise D6 ability.

# Wholly on Top Of (Craters)

A model is wholly on top of a Crater terrain feature if no part of its base (or hull) extends beyond the edge of that terrain feature.

# Worst

When referring to the worst characteristic in a unit, compare the values of all the specified characteristics of all the models/weapons in that unit. The worst value is the value all other instances in that unit are either better than or equal to (see Or Worse).

# MODIFIERS

Modifiers are rules that change a numerical value from one value to another. This can include the result of a dice roll, the characteristics of a model, and more. This section details how to apply modifiers in your games. In all cases:

1. All modifiers are cumulative.
2. If a rule instructs you to change or replace one characteristic with a specified value, change the relevant characteristic to the new value before applying any modifiers that apply from other rules (if any) to the new value.
3. You must then apply division modifiers before applying multiplication modifiers, before applying addition and then subtraction modifiers.
4. Round any fractions up after applying all modifiers.

# Example 1

A model is under the effects of two abilities, one instructing the controlling player to ‘double the Attacks characteristic of its melee weapons’ and the other saying ‘add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of its melee weapons.’ These two modifiers (x2 and +1) are cumulative and applied concurrently. If that model had a melee weapon with an unmodified Attacks characteristic of 3, then after the modifiers are applied, this would become 7 (3x2=6, then 6+1=7).

# Example 2a

An Ancient is leading a unit of Intercessors (Objective Control = 2). The unit is within Engagement Range of a unit of Rippers whose Chitinous Horrors ability states ‘While an enemy unit is within Engagement Range of this unit, halve the Objective Control characteristic of models in that enemy unit’. The Ancient has the Astartes Banner ability, which states ‘While this model is leading a unit, add 1 to the Objective Control characteristic of models in that unit’. Division modifiers are applied before addition modifiers, meaning the final modified OC of each Intercessor model in that unit is 2 (2/2=1, then 1+1=2).

# Example 2b

The same Intercessor unit from Example 2a becomes Battle-shocked, changing the OC characteristic of its models to 0. This happens before the Chitinous Horrors and Astartes Banner modifiers are applied, meaning the final, modified OC of each Intercessor model in that unit is 1 (2 --> 0, then 0/2 = 0, then 0+1=1).

# Example

If a unit contains one model with a Ld of 6+, one with a Ld of 7+ and nine with a Ld of 8+, the worst Ld characteristic in that unit is 8+.

# Wounds

If a Wound roll is successful, the attack is said to wound the target.

# You

If a rule refers to ‘you’, it is referring to the controlling player.

# Your Opponent’s Stratagems

Stratagems that your opponent uses are sometimes referred to as your opponent’s Stratagems.

# Your Stratagems

Stratagems that you use are sometimes referred to as your Stratagems.

# Your Unit (in Stratagems)

The term ‘your unit(s)’ in the Effect section of Stratagems always relates to the unit(s) selected in the Target section of that Stratagem, and never refers to any other units from your army.# Warhammer 40K - Modifying Characteristics

# Modifying Characteristics

# Modifying a Unit’s Characteristic

Some rules modify the characteristics of models, weapons and attacks. In such cases, the following points apply:

- If a rule instructs you to modify a model’s Weapon Skill (WS) characteristic, modify the WS characteristic of every melee weapon equipped by that model.
- If a rule instructs you to modify a model’s Ballistic Skill (BS) characteristic, modify the BS characteristic of every ranged weapon equipped by that model.
- After all modifiers are applied, Strength, Toughness, Attacks and Damage characteristics can never be below 1. The exception to this is where a rule specifies that you can change the Damage characteristic to 0, where this is applied before any other modifiers.
- After all modifiers are applied, Leadership characteristics can never be 4+ (or better), or 9+ (or worse).
- After all modifiers are applied, Armour Penetration and Objective Control characteristics can never be worse than 0.
- After all modifiers are applied, Move characteristics and Range characteristics for ranged weapons can never be less than 1".
- Characteristics of ‘20+"’, ‘-’, ‘*’ and ‘N/A’ can never be modified.
- If an ability modifies the Damage characteristic of a weapon, and that weapon can inflict mortal wounds in addition to the normal damage, the modifier does not apply to any mortal wounds that are inflicted.

# Modifying Characteristics by Improving, Reducing or Worsening Them

When these terms are used in rules, the following points apply:

- Improving WS, BS, Sv and Ld: When improving a WS, BS, Sv or Ld characteristic, subtract the appropriate amount from the number before the plus sign, e.g. improving a WS of 3+ by 1 would result in a WS of 2+. After all modifiers are applied, WS, BS and Sv characteristics can never be 1+ or better.
- Worsening WS, BS, Sv and Ld: When worsening a WS, BS, Sv or Ld characteristic, add the appropriate amount to the number before the plus sign, e.g. reducing a WS of 3+ by 1 would result in a WS of 4+.
- Improving AP: When improving an AP characteristic, subtract the appropriate amount from the characteristic, e.g. improving an AP of -1 by 1 would result in an AP of -2; improving an AP of 0 by 1 would result in an AP of -1.
- Reducing or Worsening AP: When reducing or worsening an AP characteristic, add the appropriate amount to the characteristic, to a maximum of 0, e.g. reducing/worsening an AP of -1 by 1 would result in an AP of 0; reducing/worsening an AP of 0 by 1 would result in an AP of 0.
- Improving or Worsening Other Characteristics: When instructed to improve/worsen a characteristic that does not include a ‘+’ or ‘-’ symbol, add/subtract the specified amount to/from that characteristic (e.g. to improve a Strength characteristic by 1, add 1 to it).

# Modifying a Damage Characteristic and Devastating Wounds

Some rules modify the Damage characteristic of an attack that has the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability.

- When a rule modifies a unit’s characteristic, it modifies that characteristic for every model/weapon in that unit.

# Modifying Dice Rolls

Some rules modify the results of dice rolls. In such cases, the following points apply:

- Modifiers are applied after any re-rolls of that dice roll.
- A dice roll can be modified above its maximum possible value (for example, a D6 roll can be modified above 6).
- A dice roll can never be modified below 1. If, after all modifiers have been applied, a dice roll would be less than 1, count that result as a 1.
- Some dice rolls can never be modified by more than -1 or +1 (e.g. Hit rolls). In such cases, after all the cumulative modifiers to a roll have been calculated, if the total modifier would be -2 or worse, it is changed to -1. Similarly, after all the cumulative modifiers to a roll have been calculated, if the total modifier would be +2 or better, it is changed to +1.

# Modifying a Stratagem’s CP Cost

Some rules modify the cost of using certain Stratagems. In such cases, the following points apply:

- The CP cost of a Stratagem can never be modified below 0CP.
- If a rule modifies the CP cost of a Stratagem when you use it, but does not specify a duration for that modifier, that modifier only applies to that usage of that Stratagem.

# Ignoring Modifiers

Some rules enable a weapon, model or unit to ignore modifiers to characteristics or rolls.

- When an ability allows you to ignore modifiers to a unit’s or model’s characteristics, unless specifically stated otherwise, this allows you to ignore modifiers to the following characteristics: Move, Toughness, Save, Wounds, Leadership and Objective Control for the model(s), and Range, Attacks, Ballistic Skill, Weapon Skill, Strength, Armour Penetration and Damage for their weapons and attacks.
- When an ability allows you to ignore modifiers to a unit’s or model’s rolls or tests, unless specifically stated otherwise, this allows you to ignore modifiers to all rolls and tests for those models and their attacks (so, for example, an Advance roll, Hit roll, Wound roll, Damage roll, Charge roll, Desperate Escape test, or Hazardous test).
- When a rule states ‘you can ignore any or all modifiers’ to a stated characteristic or roll, you can choose to ignore all of the modifiers to the stated characteristic or roll, or only some of them. For example, you can still choose to apply positive/beneficial modifiers to that characteristic, roll or test while ignoring negative/detrimental modifiers.

When a rule modifies an attack’s Damage characteristic, if that attack scores a Critical Wound, the Damage characteristic is modified before the damage is applied as mortal wounds.
