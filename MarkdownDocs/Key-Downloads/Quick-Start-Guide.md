# WARHAMMER 40,000: QUICK START GUIDE

This guide will help you get started with games of Warhammer 40,000. For more information, see the Core Rules. Warhammer 40,000 battles are played in a series of battle rounds. In each of these, both players have a turn, broken into different phases that must be completed in order.

# Game Phases

1. COMMAND PHASE
2. MOVEMENT PHASE
3. SHOOTING PHASE
4. CHARGE PHASE
5. FIGHT PHASE

# 1. COMMAND PHASE

Command: First, both players gain 1 Command point (these can be spent on Stratagems at different points in the battle round). Then resolve any rules you have that are used in your Command phase.

Battle-shock: For every unit in your army that has lost more than half of its models (or more than half of its wounds for single-model units), roll 2D6. If the result is lower than the LD (Leadership) shown on the unit’s datasheet, the unit is Battle-shocked until the start of your next Command phase. Battle-shocked units have an OC (Objective Control) of 0, and cannot be affected by friendly Stratagems.

# 2. MOVEMENT PHASE

Units that are not within 1" of enemy models (Engagement Range) can either stay still (Remain Stationary), make a Normal move or make an Advance move:

- Normal moves: Move the unit a distance in inches up to its MV (Move) characteristic, without ending within Engagement Range of enemy models.
- Advance moves: As above, but roll one D6 and add the result to the unit’s Move. Units that Advance cannot shoot this turn (except with Assault weapons) and cannot charge this turn.

Units that are within Engagement Range of enemy models can only Remain Stationary or Fall Back:

- Fall Back moves: Like a Normal move, but units that Fall Back cannot shoot or charge this turn.

# RANGED WEAPONS

|Weapon|Range|A|BS|S|AP|D|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Bolt pistol [PISTOL]|12"|1|3+|4|0|1|

# MELEE WEAPONS

|Weapon|Range|A|WS|S|AP|D|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Astartes chainsword|Melee|5|3+|4|-1|1|

# Weapon Characteristics

- Range: How far a weapon can shoot. If an enemy unit is within this range and visible to your model, it can be targeted.
- A (Attacks): The amount of shots or strikes your weapon gets, represented by the number of D6 you roll for your attack.
- BS (Ballistic Skill): How accurate your attacks are. If a Hit roll equals or beats this number, the attack hits!
- S (Strength): Any attack that hits then needs to be strong enough to wound its target.
- AP (Armour Penetration): This represents how effective the attack is against armour.
- D (Damage): If the enemy unit fails its saving throw, the attack inflicts this much damage.

# MAKING ATTACKS

Use the following sequence to make attacks one at a time:

1. HIT ROLL: Roll one D6 per attack, aiming to equal or beat the BS. An unmodified Hit roll of 6 is called a Critical Hit and is always successful.
2. WOUND ROLL: Compare the attack’s Strength with the target’s Toughness, as shown below. An unmodified Wound roll of 6 is called a Critical Wound and is always successful.

# ATTACK’S STRENGTH VS TARGET’S TOUGHNESS

D6 RESULT REQUIREDStrength is TWICE (or more than twice) the Toughness.Strength is GREATER than the Toughness.Strength is EQUAL to the Toughness.Strength is LESS than the Toughness.Strength is HALF (or less than half) the Toughness.

ALLOCATE ATTACK: Your opponent chooses which model in their unit the attack might wound (if any of those models are already wounded, the attack must be allocated to them).
SAVING THROW: Your opponent rolls one D6, subtracting the attacking weapon’s AP. If the result equals or beats their model’s SV, the attack fails. Otherwise, damage is inflicted.
INFLICT DAMAGE: Inflict damage – a model loses a number of wounds equal to the attack’s Damage characteristic.# Warhammer 40,000: Quick Start Guide

# 4. CHARGE PHASE

Your units can now charge in to assault the enemy in melee.

- One at a time, select any units you wish to charge with and follow the sequence below. Units that Advanced or Fell Back this turn cannot charge, nor can any that are within Engagement Range of the enemy.
- Select one or more enemy units for your unit to charge at.
- Roll 2D6. The result is the total distance in inches your unit can charge – if this is enough to move within 1" of every enemy unit you selected, the charge is successful – move each model towards one of those enemy units, ending in base-to-base contact if possible.

# 5. FIGHT PHASE

Every unit in each player’s army that is within Engagement Range of any enemy units now fights. Units that charged this turn fight before all others. Then, starting with the player not currently taking their turn, players alternate fighting with their units.

# 1. PILE IN

First, you can move each model in the fighting unit up to 3" towards the closest enemy model.

# 2. MAKE ATTACKS

Each model that is within Engagement Range of the enemy (or in base-to-base contact with a friendly model that is) fights with one melee weapon of your choice from those it is equipped with. To do so, follow the same Making Attacks sequence used for ranged attacks (except that melee weapons have a WS – Weapon Skill – rather than a BS).

# 3. CONSOLIDATE

After all of the fighting unit’s models have fought, you can move each model that is not in base-to-base contact with an enemy model up to 3" closer to the closest enemy model.

# Abilities

Listed below are a selection of abilities common to many units and weapons. For a full explanation of how these and other universal abilities work, see the Core Rules.

|Ability|Description|
|---|---|
|DEADLY DEMISE|Deadly Demise x: When this model is destroyed, roll one D6. On a 6, each unit within 6" suffers ‘x’ mortal wounds.|
|DEEP STRIKE|Unit can be set up in Reserves instead of on the battlefield. Unit can be set up in your Movement phase, more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models.|
|FEEL NO PAIN|Feel No Pain x+: Each time this model would lose a wound, roll one D6: if the result equals or exceeds ‘x’, that wound is not lost.|
|FIGHTS FIRST|Units with this ability that are eligible to fight do so in the Fights First step of the Fight phase.|
|INFILTRATORS|During deployment, if every model in a unit has this ability, then when you set it up, it can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from the enemy deployment zone and all enemy models.|
|LEADER|Some Character units have ‘Leader’ listed on their datasheets. Such Character units are known as Leaders, and the units they can lead – known as their Bodyguard units – are listed on their datasheet.|
|LONE OPERATIVE|Unless part of an Attached unit, this unit can only be selected as the target of a ranged attack if the attacking model is within 12".|
|SCOUTS|Scouts x": Unit can make a Normal move of up to x" before the first turn begins. If embarked in a Dedicated Transport, that Dedicated Transport can make this move instead.|
|ASSAULT|Can be shot even if the bearer’s unit Advanced.|
|BLAST|Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic for every five models in the target unit (rounding down). Can never be used against a target that is within Engagement Range of any units from the attacking model’s army.|
|DEVASTATING WOUNDS|A Critical Wound inflicts mortal wounds equal to the weapon’s Damage characteristic, instead of any normal damage.|
|HEAVY|Add 1 to Hit rolls if the bearer’s unit Remained Stationary this turn.|
|IGNORES COVER|Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, the target cannot have the Benefit of Cover against that attack.|
|INDIRECT FIRE|Can target and make attacks against units that are not visible to the attacking unit. If no models are visible in a target unit when it is selected, then when making an attack against that target with an Indirect Fire weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll and the target has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.|
|LETHAL HITS|Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, a Critical Hit automatically wounds the target.|
|PISTOL|Can be shot even if the bearer’s unit is within Engagement Range of enemy units, but must target one of those enemy units. Cannot be shot alongside any other non-Pistol weapon (except by a Monster or Vehicle).|
|RAPID FIRE X|Increase the Attacks by ‘x’ when targeting units within half range.|
|SUSTAINED HITS X|Each Critical Hit scores ‘x’ additional hits on the target.|
|TORRENT|Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, that attack automatically hits the target.|
|TWIN-LINKED|Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, you can re-roll that attack’s Wound roll.|# Warhammer 40,000: Quick Start Guide
