# Adeptus Titanicus Army Rules

# ADEPTUS TITANICUS

# ARMY RULES

Titans are amongst the largest war engines to be found anywhere in the galaxy, ponderous battleships of the land whose weapon batteries are capable of obliterating entire formations of enemy troops. Created before the dawn of the Imperium, each god-engine is a miracle of forgotten technology. During the catastrophic wars of the Horus Heresy, the once-mighty Titan Legions warred against one another in great numbers, but their numbers are now much diminished. While loyalist Titans still defend the forge worlds of the Adeptus Mechanicus and march against the enemies of the Imperium, their traitorous brethren were consigned to the Eye of Terror where they became Chaos Titans – twisted mockeries of their former glory who now fight alongside warbands of traitors and renegades.

# TOWERING EXAMPLE

When mustering your army, if your Army Faction is Adeptus Titanicus, ignore the Select Detachment Rules step. In the Select Warlord step, select one Adeptus Titanicus model from your army to be your Warlord, even though that model does not have the Character keyword.

# TITANIC SUPPORT

If every model in your army has the Imperium keyword, you can include 1 Adeptus Titanicus model in your army, even if it does not have the Faction keyword you selected in the Select Army Faction step.

# TITANICUS TRAITORIS

You can use the Adeptus Titanicus datasheets in this document to represent Titanicus Traitoris models if you wish. To do so, on those datasheets and on this Army Rules card, replace all instances of the Imperium keyword with Chaos, and replace all instances of the Adeptus Titanicus Faction keyword with Titanicus Traitoris. For the purposes of points values, use those published for the equivalent Adeptus Titanicus models.

Designer’s Note: Titans are colossal war machines that can turn the tide of battle. As such, the points values of some of these models are greater than even Onslaught-sized battles can accommodate; they are designed for battlefields of the most apocalyptic scale you can imagine!# Warhound Titan
