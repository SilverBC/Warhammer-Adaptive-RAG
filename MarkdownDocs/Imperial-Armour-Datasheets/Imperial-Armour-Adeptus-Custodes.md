# CONTEMPTOR-GALATUS DREADNOUGHT

Like the Sentinel Guard of the ancient Legio Custodes, the Contemptor-Galatus is armed with a power blade and battle shield, albeit of a type greatly superior in size and potency. Coupled with the already resilient Contemptor chassis, this wargear enables the Galatus to stride through the inferno of battle with impunity, slaying elite infantry and crippling vehicles.
