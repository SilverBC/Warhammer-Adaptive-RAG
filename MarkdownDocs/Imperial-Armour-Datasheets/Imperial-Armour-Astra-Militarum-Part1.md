# Macharius Vanquisher

Replacing the Macharius’ twin battle cannon with the Macharius vanquisher cannon creates the vanquisher variant; a deadly tank-hunter that can devastate whole squadrons of lighter vehicles or knock out rival super-heavies. The Macharius vanquisher cannon is costly, but its presence can tip the balance of tank warfare.

The turret weapon of the Macharius Vulcan is the fearsome vulcan mega-bolter. Also carried by Warhound-class Titans, this twin rotary weapon emits a torrent of explosive rounds that can annihilate infantry. So furious is the Vulcan’s rate of fire that tank crews use every inch of cabin space to store as many extra rounds as possible.

# HADES BREACHING DRILL

Originally designed for industrial mining, the Hades Breaching Drill has proved itself to be a valuable weapon of siegecraft. The machine’s powerful melta-cutter is capable of pounding through earth, rock and even reinforced ferrocrete, boring a tunnel broad enough for troops to assault through and mangling any living foes that block its path.
