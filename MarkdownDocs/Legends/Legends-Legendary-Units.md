# WARHAMMER 40,000

# WARHAMMER LEGENDS

# LEGENDARY UNITS VERSION 1.1

# DEATH GUARD

Legends units can be included in Death Guard armies:

- Chaos Lord on Palanquin of Nurgle
- Gellerpox Infected
- Hell Blade
- Hell Talon
- Mutoid Vermin
- Sorcerer on Palanquin of Nurgle

To do so:

- That unit gains the Nurgle keyword, if it does not have it already.
- Replace instances of the Heretic Astartes Faction keyword with Death Guard.
- Replace instances of the Dark Pacts ability with Nurgle’s Gift (Aura).

# WORLD EATERS

The following Heretic Astartes Legends units can be included in World Eaters armies:

- Hell Blade
- Hell Talon

To do so:

- That unit gains the Khorne keyword, if it does not have it already.
- Replace instances of the Heretic Astartes Faction keyword with World Eaters.
- Replace instances of the Dark Pacts ability with Blessings of Khorne.

Use the points values listed for the Heretic Astartes versions of these datasheets.

# THOUSAND SONS

The following Heretic Astartes Legends units can be included in Thousand Sons armies:

- Chaos Lord on Disc of Tzeentch
- Hell Blade
- Hell Talon

To do so:

- That unit gains the Tzeentch keyword, if it does not have it already.
- Replace instances of the Heretic Astartes Faction keyword with Thousand Sons.
- Remove all instances of the Dark Pacts ability and, if that unit has the Psyker keyword, it gains the Cabal of Sorcerers 1 ability.

Use the points values listed for the Heretic Astartes versions of these datasheets.# Warhammer 40K - Legendary Weapons and Wargear

# LEGENDARY WEAPONS AND WARGEAR

Sometimes the weapons and wargear options for some models are updated to reflect newer models, and some venerable loadouts are no longer described on the datasheets themselves. If a model in your collection is equipped with such weapons or items of wargear, then you can still use that model in your games. When doing so, you must use the rules as described on the datasheet. You are free to select any wargear options allowed by that datasheet, but we recommend selecting those that most closely resemble those found on your model.

For example, if you have a model equipped with a chainfist, but that specific weapon is no longer a supported weapon on the model’s datasheet, you could treat that weapon as a power fist (assuming a power fist is a supported weapon for that model).

# LEGENDARY SPACE MARINE CHARACTERS

Veteran Space Marine players will notice that many datasheets that used to describe older Space Marine characters no longer have a dedicated datasheet (e.g. there are no longer separate Chaplain and Primaris Chaplain datasheets). In these cases, players should use the most appropriate datasheet for their model as presented in Codex: Space Marines, bearing in mind the note on the left regarding legendary weapons and wargear.

# LEGENDARY PROXIES

While the following models no longer have specific datasheets available for them, they can be used as proxies for other models, representing the corresponding units shown below. Such models use the listed units’ datasheets, and count as them for all rules purposes. Note that if such a model does not have exactly the same items of wargear as those offered by the datasheet they count as, then use the wargear options that most closely resemble those found on the model.
