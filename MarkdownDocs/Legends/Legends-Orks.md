- Ramshackle Cover: Each time a ranged attack is allocated to a model, if that model is not fully visible to every model in the attacking unit because of this Fortification, that model has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.
- Workshop: When this Fortification is set up, all parts of it must be set up within 1” of another part. At the end of your Movement phase, each friendly Orks Vehicle model within 12” of this Fortification can regain up to D3 lost wounds (roll separately for each model). Each model can only be affected by this ability once per turn.
- Fortification: While an enemy unit is only within Engagement Range of one or more Fortifications from your army:
- That unit can still be selected as the target of ranged attacks, but each time such an attack is made, unless it is made with a Pistol, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
- Models in that unit do not need to take Desperate Escape tests due to Falling Back while Battle-shocked, except for those that will move over enemy models when doing so.

Squiggoths are enormous scaly creatures bred as beasts of war by Ork Pigdoks.

Made for when a normal Trukk just isn't big enough, Big Trakks are heavy rigs that can carry the Orks over the worst terrain or mount their Big Gunz and lots of gear. They are not all that fast, nor are they as tough as a full-blown Battlewagon, but Big Trakks make up for these shortfalls with their hauling power.
