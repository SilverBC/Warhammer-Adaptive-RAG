Some Deathwatch units have the Kill Team ability, which is detailed below, and referenced on the datasheets.

Kill Team: Each time an attack targets this unit, if it contains models with different Toughness characteristics, until the attacking unit has finished making its attacks, use the Toughness characteristic of the majority of the models in that unit when determining what roll is required for that attack to successfully wound. If two or more Toughness characteristics are tied for majority, use the highest value.

For the purposes of determining which models in this unit can embark within a Transport, Kill Team Terminator models, Kill Team Outrider models, Kill Team Biker models and models equipped with a jump pack each take up the space of 2 models, but can otherwise embark within any Transport their unit can embark within, even though similar models in other units have the Terminator, Mounted or Jump Pack keywords.

For the purposes of interacting with terrain features, all models in units with this ability are considered Infantry models, even though similar models in other units may have the Mounted or Jump Pack keywords.

Designer’s Note: While the abstractions in the above rule cause some models to behave differently to similar models in other units, they are designed to minimise complicated movement, Transport and Benefit of Cover rules.
