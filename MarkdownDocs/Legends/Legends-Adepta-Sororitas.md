# FORTIFICATION

While an enemy unit is only within Engagement Range of one or more Fortifications from your army:

- That unit can still be selected as the target of ranged attacks, but each time such an attack is made, unless it is made with a Pistol, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
- Models in that unit do not need to take Desperate Escape tests due to Falling Back while Battle-shocked, except for those that will move over enemy models when doing so.

# ABILITIES

- CORE: Deadly Demise D6
- FACTION: Acts of Faith

# Consecrated Ground

When this Fortification is set up, all parts of it must be set up within 1" of another part. Friendly Adepta Sororitas Infantry models can be set up or end any type of move on top of the floor sections of this Fortification. While an Adepta Sororitas unit from your army is within 1" of this Fortification, that unit can perform one additional Act of Faith per phase.

# Holy Cover

Each time a ranged attack is allocated to a model, if that model is not fully visible to every model in the attacking unit because of this Fortification, that model has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.
