# Warhammer 40K - Grotmas Gitz

# GROTMAS GITZ

At that most wonderful time of the year, when the season of dakka rains festive fire across the stars, cackling grots prepare to spread ill will to all. Naughty or nice, it doesn’t matter to these squig-riding loons because they couldn’t read the lists even if they bothered to try. Better to simply batter everyone with a hail of explosive gifts and be back home in time for fungusnog and roasted snotling!
