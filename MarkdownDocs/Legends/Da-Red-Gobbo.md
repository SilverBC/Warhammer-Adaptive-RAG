# Da Red Gobbo

Scampering across the ruined rooftops with a cackle of glee, Da Red Gobbo brings explosive surprises aplenty. In the spirit of giving, he passes out the party favours to all the kunnin’ little grots, and all he asks in return is that they share their short-fused goodies with every git they see. After all, ’tis the season for dakka!
