# COMBAT PATROL: ADEPTUS MECHANICUS

# MANIPLE VERASK-ALPHA

# Combat Patrol: Adeptus Mechanicus

# Maniple Verask-Alpha

# Abilities

The datasheets required to use Maniple Verask-Alpha can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Doctrina Imperatives – that is referenced on many units’ datasheets, and is described below.

Your Tech-Priest Enginseer model is your Warlord and has the Omniballistic Data-Tether Enhancement. You can replace this with Imperative Surge-wafer.

# Default Enhancement

# Doctrina Imperatives

An Adeptus Mechanicus army marching to war is a sight both terrifying and glorious, each holy warrior a disturbing fusion of Human and machine. While the ruling Tech-Priests and their fanatical followers raise modified voices in praise of the Machine God, their Skitarii soldiery and Servitor creations are controlled by doctrina imperatives loaded by their masters to augment and adapt the warriors’ abilities.

At the start of the battle round, you can select one of the Doctrina Imperatives below. Until the end of the battle round, that Doctrina Imperative is active for your army, and all units from your army that have the Doctrina Imperatives ability gain the relevant abilities shown below.

# Omniballistic Data-Tether

An ancient and valuable augmetic wired deep into the meat of this warrior’s cerebellum, this device maintains a constant data-choral uplink with servitor satellites in orbit. Their binharic augury lights up the bearer’s optic feeds with advanced targeting cogitations.

Each time the bearer’s unit is selected to shoot, you can re-roll one Hit roll and you can re-roll one Wound roll when resolving those attacks.

# Doctrina Imperatives

|Imperative|Abilities|
|---|---|
|Protector Imperative|- Ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [HEAVY] ability.
- Each time a ranged attack targets this unit, if this unit is within your deployment zone, worsen the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.
|
|Conqueror Imperative|- Ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [ASSAULT] ability.
- Each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack, if the target of that attack is within your opponent’s deployment zone, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.
|

# Optional Enhancement

# Imperative Surge-Wafer

When compelled to do so by predetermined strategic parameters, the bearer of this item reverently snaps its plastek housing and inserts the data wafer within into their augmetic receptor. At once, they are filled by a divine surge of motive force, their mental cogitators whirring with data-overcharge that flows out into the minds of their fellow faithful. Inspired by their moment of data-revelation, the Omnissiah’s faithful gun down their victims with inhuman accuracy and efficiency.

Once per battle, when the bearer’s unit is selected to shoot, it can use this ability. If it does, until the end of the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in the bearer’s unit have the [PRECISION] ability.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# EXPLORATOR ACQUISITION

Rumours of hidden archeotech have led the servants of the Machine God to this place. With unbelievers swarming the area, the precious technologies must be swiftly located, reverently extracted, and borne away to safety.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your Command phase, roll one D6, adding 1 to the result for each objective marker you control: on a 7+, a piece of valuable archeotech is found and you score 4VP. You cannot score more than 12VP from this secondary objective.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# HOLY APPARATUS

The sanctity of the Omnissiah’s blessed war machines – and the lives of those high priests who shepherd them into battle – must be preserved. If this be at the cost of countless lesser servants of the Omnissiah, then it is the privilege of those cyborg drudges to give their lives for so righteous a cause.

- You score 4VP if your Warlord is not destroyed.
- You score 4VP if your Onager Dunecrawler model is not destroyed and is not Below Half-strength.
- You score 2VP if your Onager Dunecrawler model is not destroyed but is Below Half-strength.

# STRATAGEMS

You can use the following Stratagems:

# RETRIBUTION CODES

MANIPLE VERASK-ALPHA – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Vengeful subroutines within this Tech-Priest’s augmetic architecture ensure that, should they be slain, a purge code is beamed far and wide directing the faithful to hunt down their killer.

- WHEN: Any phase.
- TARGET: One Tech-Priest model from your army that was just destroyed by an attack made by an enemy model. You can use this Stratagem on that model even though it was just destroyed.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the battle, each time an Adeptus Mechanicus model from your army makes an attack that targets that enemy model’s unit, re-roll a Hit roll of 1.

# REACTIVE FIELD-SHROUD

MANIPLE VERASK-ALPHA – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Triggered by autodetection of incoming enemy fire, single-burst shield capacitors raise a defensive power field around their bearers before burning out in showers of sparks.

- WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.
- TARGET: One Tech-Priest or Skitarii unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, models in your unit have a 4+ invulnerable save.

# RETROGRADIAL TARGETING

MANIPLE VERASK-ALPHA – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Whether it be by literal ocular implants in the back of their heads, or through advanced cover-target subroutines, this unit is able to lay down deadly accurate volleys to suppress the foe even as they fall back from combat.

- WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after a Tech-Priest unit from your army ends a Fall Back move.
- TARGET: That Tech-Priest unit.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit is eligible to shoot in a turn in which it Fell Back.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet
