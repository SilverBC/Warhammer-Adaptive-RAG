# COMBAT PATROL: DARK ANGELS

# MORDEKAI’S JUDGEMENT

The Dark Angels who march to war at Chaplain Mordekai’s side are being tested. Mordekai is exacting and merciless, even for an Interrogator-Chaplain. He sees his battle-brothers’ souls laid bare beneath his gimlet gaze. Accordingly, he is an excellent judge of whether a Dark Angel’s combat record and spiritual fortitude is enough to see him advanced to the next circle of secrecy within the Chapter. Those who impress Mordekai on the field of battle may soon find themselves learning dark new truths.

# COMBAT PATROL: DARK ANGELS

# MORDEKAI’S JUDGEMENT

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Mordekai’s Judgement can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Oath of Moment – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

Your Chaplain model is your Warlord and has the Stoic Exemplar Enhancement. You can replace this with Zealous Wrath.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# OATH OF MOMENT

In battle, Space Marines swear mighty oaths to destroy the enemies of the Emperor and uphold the honour of their Chapter, and such vows are sacrosanct. When the Angels of Death strike, they do so with the precision of a surgeon and the force of a thunderbolt. Experience and strategic expertise help them to read the shifting shape of the battle with post-human speed and clarity, directing their wrath towards one priority target after another. Command assets are annihilated, leaving the enemy reeling leaderless. Heavy armour, potent artillery and the vaunted elites of the foe’s forces are laid waste with horrifying speed, until the Emperor’s Angels of Death stand victorious over a field of smouldering wreckage and bolt-riddled corpses, and honour is finally satisfied.

# STOIC EXEMPLAR

This warrior stands firm in the face of the enemy onslaught, a living embodiment of the Dark Angels’ grim resolve and a foreboding source of inspiration to his battle-brothers.

Each time a melee attack targets the bearer’s unit, if one or more enemy units ended a Charge move within Engagement Range of the bearer’s unit this turn, subtract 1 from the Wound roll.

# At the start of your Command phase

Select one unit from your opponent’s army. Until the start of your next Command phase, that enemy unit is your Oath of Moment target. Each time a model with this ability makes an attack that targets your Oath of Moment target, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# ZEALOUS WRATH

Bellowing oaths of duty and vengeance, the Chaplain leads his warriors on the charge, certain in the knowledge that no enemy can escape nor withstand his righteous fury.

You can re-roll Advance and Charge rolls made for the bearer’s unit.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Information

# Secondary Objectives

# Default Secondary Objective

# Endless Hunt

In the never-ending hunt for the reviled Fallen, the Dark Angels must seize upon each new strategic lead and source of intel they can find, ransacking it for clues that only the Inner Circle truly understand before pressing on once again.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your turn, you score 3VP if an Intercessor Squad unit from your army that is not Battle-shocked is within range of an objective marker you control and which is not within your deployment zone. If that objective marker is within your opponent’s deployment zone, you score 5VP instead.

# Stratagems

# Available Stratagems

|Stratagem|Type|Cost|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Resolute in Duty|Strategic Ploy Stratagem|1CP|Once they have been commanded and have oathed themselves to a task, the Dark Angels exhibit a frighteningly singular and unyielding determination. WHEN: Your Command phase. TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes Infantry unit from your army. EFFECT: Until the start of your next Command phase, add 1 to the Objective Control characteristic of models in your unit.|
|Teachings of the Lion|Strategic Ploy Stratagem|1CP|The Primarch of the Dark Angels is a master strategist and tactician, a peerless general and warrior whose martial codes lie at the heart of his gene-sons’ stoic yet flexible fighting style. WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after an Adeptus Astartes Infantry unit from your army Falls Back. TARGET: That Adeptus Astartes Infantry unit. EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit is eligible to either shoot or declare a charge (but not both) in a turn in which it Fell Back.|

# Optional Secondary Objective

# Archeotech Reliquary

The Dark Angels possess many ancient and pseudo-secret weapons from the earliest days of the Imperium. Thus they comprehend the value – and the inherent perils – of such devices better than most. Should such a dangerous relic appear upon the battlefield they will be quick to secure it, both to keep it from the wrong hands and to ensure they – and they alone – can make use of whatever secrets it may reveal.

|Stratagem|Type|Cost|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Fortitude of the First|Battle Tactic Stratagem|1CP|Ever since the long-lost days of the Great Crusade, the Dark Angels have been renowned for their tenacity in defence and the stoic determination with which they endure the worst their foes can hurl at them. WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets. TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes Infantry unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks and is within range of an objective marker you control. EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, your unit has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.|

At the start of the first battle round, your opponent must select one objective marker.

At the end of the battle, you score 10VP if you control that objective marker.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet
