# Combat Patrol: Thousand Sons

# The Coven Temporus

Ahrak the Time Weaver travels the stars by esoteric means, riding the temporal flow of the universe to skip back and forth through the ages of reality. He seeks artefacts of ancient provenance, though whether to further his own power or that of the Thousand Sons remains to be seen. To aid him in his quest, Ahrak leads a warband of twisted Tzeentchian Beastmen known as Tzaangors, as well as his personal bodyguard of hulking Scarab Occult Terminators.

# COMBAT PATROL: THOUSAND SONS

# THE COVEN TEMPORUS

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use the Coven Temporus can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Cabal of Sorcerers – that is referenced on many units’ datasheets, and is described below.

Your Infernal Master model is your Warlord and has the Temporal Sorceries Enhancement. You can replace this with Arch-Diabolist.

# ENHANCEMENTS

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# CABAL OF SORCERERS

The Thousand Sons channel the arcane through battlefield ritual, beseeching the Changer of the Ways to aid them.

At the end of your Command phase, each model from your army with this ability that is on the battlefield (excluding Battle-shocked models) generates you a number of Cabal points equal to the number shown in its ability (e.g. a model with the Cabal of Sorcerers 2 ability would generate you 2 Cabal points). The combined total of these is your Cabal points pool.

During the battle round, you can use Rituals from the list below, deducting the Cabal points cost of each one from your Cabal points pool. If you do not have enough Cabal points for a Ritual, you cannot use it. Each Ritual can only be used once per phase. At the start of your next Command phase, your Cabal points pool resets to zero. Each time you use a Ritual, select one Thousand Sons Psyker model from your army, then apply that Ritual’s effect using that Psyker.

# TEMPORAL SORCERIES

This warrior is able to manipulate the flow of linear chronology and to recklessly stride forward and backward through the strands of time and fate. They appear as if from nowhere in the midst of battle, fade to a flickering echo of their possible future selves, and enjoy the inconstant insights of perceiving that which may yet come to pass.

The bearer has the Deep Strike and Lone Operative abilities. In addition, at the end of your Command phase, if the bearer is on the battlefield, you gain D3 Cabal points.

# Rituals

|Ritual|Cabal Points|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Weaver of Fates (Psychic)|2 Cabal points|Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Once during that phase, when a saving throw is failed for a friendly Thousand Sons model whose unit is within 18" of this Psyker, you can re-roll that saving throw.|
|Echoes from the Warp (Psychic)|6 Cabal points|Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Once this phase, you can select this Psyker’s unit as the target of a Stratagem for 0CP, even if you have already used that Stratagem this phase.|

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# ARCH-DIABOLIST

Many and strange are the pacts this warrior has struck with the daemonic entities of the warp. The powers and infernal allies these bargains have earned him ensure that his foes can never predict where he will unleash his devastating powers next.

The bearer has the Deep Strike and Lone Operative abilities. In addition, both of the bearer’s Screamer Invocation weapon profiles have the [PISTOL] ability.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# SORCEROUS RITUAL

As the fury of battle waxes hot and the tides of the warp stir beyond the veil of realspace, so the sorcerous masters of the Thousand Sons harness the roiling warp energies with chants and gestures. These powers they funnel through sites of arcane significance across the battlefield and in so doing, draw ever closer to their ritual’s nightmarish conclusion.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your opponent’s Fight phase, if one or more Psyker models from your army are within range of an objective marker that you control and that is not within your deployment zone, roll one D6, adding 1 to the result for each remaining Cabal point you have (to a maximum of +3): on a 5+, you score 3VP.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# BRINGER OF CHANGE

It is said by the mortal worshippers of Tzeentch that their deity delights in endless, unbridled change. There is no surer way to secure his favour than to unleash the powers of the warp to twist the bodies and minds of the enemy into riotously mutated new forms.

At the end of each phase, you score D3 VP if one or more enemy models were destroyed by Psychic Attacks made by models from your army that phase.

# STRATAGEMS

# WREATHED IN WARPFLAME

Chanted incantations summon leaping fires of vivid purple and blue that leap hungrily to engulf the foe. The larger and more imposing the victim, the more vigorously the flames consume them.

- Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: Fight phase.
- TARGET: One Thousand Sons unit from your army (excluding Tzaangors units) that has not been selected to fight this phase.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, melee weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability and each time a model in your unit makes an attack that targets a Monster or Vehicle unit, an unmodified Hit roll of 5+ scores a Critical Hit.

# MUTANT CUNNING

Infused with the power of Tzeentch, Tzaangor sense the approach of danger and – through cunning evasion, chameleonic feathers or minor cantrips – preserve themselves from harm.

- Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.
- TARGET: One Tzaangors unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
- EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal move of up to D6" and, until the end of the phase, each time a ranged attack targets your unit, models in your unit have the Benefit of Cover against that attack.

# MALIGN ENTANGLEMENT

Sorcerous mists billow about the feet of the foe, coiling into tendrils that drag at their limbs and befuddle their thoughts.

- Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase, just after an enemy unit has declared a charge.
- TARGET: One Thousand Sons unit from your army that was selected as a target of that charge.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, subtract 2 from Charge rolls made for that enemy unit.

You cannot score more than 12VP from this secondary objective.# Warhammer 40K - Ahrak the Time Weaver and Scarab Occult Terminators

As an Infernal Master, Ahrak has forged pacts with daemonic entities, euphemistically called tutelaries. Upon the battlefield he can unleash the powers of these malign familiars to engulf his foes in swarms of momentarily corporeal terrors, to hear whispers of the future or to master the currents of the empyrean itself.

The Scarab Occult fight with all the merciless skill they did when they were Magnus’ living bodyguards, often striking into the heart of the foe via sorcerous teleportation. Wielding vicious ritual blades based on the ancient Prosperine khopesh, they cleave through those victims not laid low by their salvoes of lethal firepower.

Brayhorn blasts and avian shrieks herald the onset of the Tzaangors. These mutated shock troops surge into battle wielding roaring chainswords with vicious skill. Return shots and blows are deflected by whirling skeins of dark sorcery, for these creatures belong to Tzeentch body and soul.
