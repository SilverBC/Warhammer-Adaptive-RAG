# WARHAMMER 40,000

yr Solarien watched his foes’ every move with a silent, calculating intensity. His black eyes roved back and forth as he analysed the renegade forces and equipment, their level of discipline. He could tell from the way they walked, the way they held their lasguns, their general misguided casualness, that they were not expecting an assault on the fortress’ southern gate. Those who manned the walls faced away from the stronghold, staring lazily out at the rubble where the city buildings had been demolished to make a kill zone. That would be their undoing, because the Raven Guard were already inside the fortress walls.

Unbeknownst to the renegade guardsmen, Solarien’s strike force had scaled the outer walls under cover of darkness, dispatching a platoon of sentries with such bloodless efficiency that their fellow traitors, upon discovering their absence, assumed they had abandoned their posts. In reality, the heretics’ corpses had been fed into a recyc-shrine that, even now, was mulching their broken corpses into bloody paste. It was, thought Solarien, too good a fate for them.

Observations complete, the Lieutenant climbed down from his vantage point amidst the gantries of a refuelling depot. A squad of Infiltrators awaited him in the darkness, their black armour barely visible in the gloom.

# Strike Team

‘Javaan, your squad will secure gate-bastion primaris at ground level. Coordinates attached.’ Solarien blink-clicked the objective onto his strike team’s helmet displays. ‘Codicier Xarius will accompany you. Kasz, you and the other half of the squad will accompany me to gate-bastion secundus. Our mission is to open the gate.’ Another icon appeared on their helmet displays. ‘Orevis?’ Solarien spoke into the comms now.

‘Standing by,’ replied the sergeant. ‘We can be on target in just under two minutes.’

‘Acknowledged. You have your coordinates. Begin your approach.’ The vox chirped once in confirmation.

Solarien turned to his strike team and moved towards the door. The two halves of Squad Javaan assembled either side of him, bolters ready. ‘Victory or Death, brothers’, said Solarien as he pushed open the hatch.

The door squealed as it opened, but the sound was lost amidst the general din of a fortress preparing for battle. The majority of the renegade forces had headed north to where the main Imperial army had gathered, leaving the southern gate only partially defended. It was this gate that Solarien and his strike force now ran towards.

A booming staccato rhythm drowned out all other sound as a torrent of hyper-accelerated autocannon rounds punched through the air and slammed into the Sentinel’s cab. The armoured shell dented, buckled, then, under the intense salvo, folded in on itself entirely. The heaven-sent fusillade stopped only when the war machine crumbled to its knees. Around Solarien, the heretics ran for their lives.

‘Enemy eradicated.’ said Sergeant Orevis as his squad of Suppressors landed on the fortress walls. Their autocannons hammered once more. Ejected casings and slain renegades alike fell from the walls. ‘Objective secured.’

# Full Rules for Fielding a Stealthy Space Marine Combat Patrol

Space Marines are trained in the art of war from a young age. During their induction, they are tutored in stealth, heavy weapons, close combat weapons, vehicles, jump packs, and, of course, the bolt rifle. Such training makes each Space Marine a versatile asset to reconnaissance and fieldcraft. They are part of the army’s main battle line, drop troops, vehicle crew or even as part of a vanguard assault force. These far-reaching, independent strike teams use stealth and subterfuge as often as blades and bolt weapons to complete their missions.

Over the next few pages, you will find new rules for fielding a Phobos-armoured Space Marine strike team in your games of Combat Patrol. These vanguard forces excel at infiltration, reconnaissance and disrupting enemy battle lines. As such, you will find Enhancements, Stratagems and secondary objectives that reinforce that background alongside all the datasheets for these units.# Warhammer 40K - Strike Team Solarian

# WARHAMMER 40K

# STRIKE TEAM SOLARIEN

# INFILTRATOR SQUAD (10 MODELS)

Every model is equipped with: bolt pistol; marksman bolt carbine; close combat weapon.

The Infiltrator Squad have the Omni-scramblers ability, which, when combined with their ability to split into two units using the Patrol Squads rule, makes it possible to cover a large portion of the battlefield and prevent any form of Reserves units from catching you off guard. Both the secondary objectives you have available to you reward careful, patient play. Reconnaissance in Force, thanks to its dependency on the nearby No Man’s Land objectives, can allow you to score some early VP before retreating, dealing with the enemy, then recapturing them later in the game. Pinpoint Purge rewards careful prioritisation and targeting selection. Regardless of which you pick, the Omni-scramblers will be an important tool in controlling the flow of battle.

# LIEUTENANT SOLARIEN (1 MODEL)

This model is equipped with: bolt pistol; master-crafted bolt carbine; paired combat blades.

Your Lieutenant has access to two very versatile Enhancements. The first, Auto-choral Resonators, makes it possible for your Combat Patrol to seize control of important objectives while still being able to move away from them. This can prove extremely useful when combined with the Infiltrators ability, as it allows you to seize an important mid-table objective before retreating out of the enemy threat range, scoring both primary and secondary objectives without giving up easy charges to your opponent.

Against certain armies you may find the Stealthy Hunter Enhancement becomes a more attractive option, as over a few turns it allows your Lieutenant to bring down most Infantry characters. The Lone Operative ability, coupled with his movement-after-shooting capability, will keep your Lieutenant safe from any reprisals.

# SUPPRESSOR SQUAD (3 MODELS)

Every model is equipped with: accelerator autocannon; bolt pistol; close combat weapon.

Careful usage of this unit is an important aspect of the Combat Patrol. They can put out a lot of very powerful shots, and, when augmented by the Giantslayer Doctrine, are your primary tool for dealing with enemy armour. While it can be tempting to keep them stationary to take advantage of the Heavy weapon ability, it is generally a good idea to keep them mobile, using their long range and high movement speed to keep them away from all but the threat they are targeting.

# LIBRARIAN XARIUS (1 MODEL)

This model is equipped with: bolt pistol; Smite; force weapon.

The Librarian is one of the two main heavy-hitting elements of the force, with his potent Smite ability able to take down some of the tougher enemies you may face. It is important not to ignore his Shrouding ability, though, as this Combat Patrol is not notably durable. Therefore, keeping your assets alive, be it through the Stealth ability, careful positioning or the Rapid Repositioning Stratagem, will be key to surviving into the later turns and achieving ultimate victory.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol - Strike Team Solarien

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Strike Team Solarien can be found on the following pages and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Oath of Moment – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet and is described below.

# OATH OF MOMENT

In battle, Space Marines swear mighty oaths to destroy the enemies of the Emperor and uphold the honour of their Chapter, and such vows are sacrosanct. When the Angels of Death strike, they do so with the precision of a surgeon and the force of a thunderbolt. Experience and strategic expertise help them to read the shifting shape of the battle with post-human speed and clarity, directing their wrath towards one priority target after another. Command assets are annihilated, leaving the enemy reeling leaderless. Heavy armour, potent artillery and the vaunted elites of the foe’s forces are laid waste with horrifying speed, until the Emperor’s Angels of Death stand victorious over a field of smouldering wreckage and bolt-riddled corpses, and honour is finally satisfied.

At the start of your Command phase, select one unit from your opponent’s army. Until the start of your next Command phase, that enemy unit is your Oath of Moment target. Each time a model with this ability makes an attack that targets your Oath of Moment target, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

# ENHANCEMENTS

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# AUTO-CHORAL RESONATORS

Even as he ghosts across the battlefield, this commander leaves in his wake activated auto-choral resonators that link with Space Marine strike vessels in orbit. These beam up vital intelligence and scan the localised area, warning of enemy incursions.

At the end of your Command phase, if the bearer’s unit is within range of an objective marker you control, that objective marker remains under your control, even if you have no models within range of it, until your opponent controls it at the start or end of any turn.

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# STEALTHY HUNTER

This commander is a veritable ghost of the battlefield, slipping through palls of smoke and flickering shadow and leaving barely a footprint to mark his passage. The first many foes know of his onset is when a deadly accurate volley of bolt shells rains down upon their position.

The bearer has the Lone Operative and Stealth abilities, and its master-crafted bolt carbine has the [ANTI-INFANTRY 4+], [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] and [PRECISION] abilities.

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# RECONNAISSANCE IN FORCE

The role of such a vanguard force is often to drive the enemy back from and then secure vital routes through no man’s land, securing a temporary foothold or corridor that can be reinforced by heavier elements moving up in their wake.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your turn:

- You score 2VP if you control at least one objective marker in No Man’s Land and you control the same number of objective markers in No Man’s Land as your opponent does.
- You score 4VP if you control at least one objective marker in No Man’s Land and you control more objective markers in No Man’s Land than your opponent does.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# PINPOINT PURGE

Having moved into an advantageous position behind enemy lines, the vanguard troops must now slay a series of high-priority enemy targets to weaken the foe at this key location.

You score 2VP each time a model from your army destroys an enemy unit with a ranged attack. If that unit was your Oath of Moment target, you score 3VP instead.

# STRATAGEMS

You can use the following Stratagems:

# VANGUARD STRIKE

1CP - Experts in operating alone without battlefield support, these Phobos-armoured warriors move swiftly to seize strategic assets or locations that – however temporarily – are crucial to whatever mission of sabotage, assassination or reconnaissance they have assigned themselves.

WHEN: The Command phase.

TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army.

EFFECT: Until the start of your next Command phase, add 1 to the Objective Control characteristic of models in your unit.

# GIANTSLAYER DOCTRINE

1CP - The role of Suppressors in this strike team is vital, applying their heavy mobile firepower to exploit the weak points of enemy war engines and monstrous beasts before they can tear the opposing forces apart.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

TARGET: One Suppressor Squad unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of ranged weapons equipped by models in your unit by 1, and those weapons have the [ANTI-MONSTER 4+] and [ANTI-VEHICLE 4+] abilities.

# RAPID REPOSITIONING

1CP - These warriors read their enemies’ movements with measured strategic clarity, responding in a fluid and rapidly evolving fashion to deny the foe territory or evade vengeful counterattacks.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Movement phase, just after an enemy unit ends a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move.

TARGET: One Phobos unit from your army that is within 9" of that unit and not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.

EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal move of up to 3".# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet
