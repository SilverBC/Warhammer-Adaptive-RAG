# Combat Patrol: Adeptus Custodes

# Guardians of the Throne

When they fight as one, the Adeptus Custodes and Sisters of Silence are sometimes known as the Talons of the Emperor. Shield-Captain Tyvan’s is just such a force, combining the demigod might of Custodians with the deadly witch-hunting abilities of the Silent Sisters. The result is a force that has purged heretics from one side of the Segmentum Solar to the other.

This Combat Patrol includes the units shown below. Before the battle, in the Select Combat Patrol and Enhancement step, you must select either the Custodian Guard unit or the Vertus Praetors unit to include in your Combat Patrol for the battle.

|---|---|
|A. Shield-Captain Tyvan (1 model)|This model is equipped with: sentinel blade; praesidium shield.|
|B. Prosecutors (5 models)|Every model is equipped with: boltgun; close combat weapon.|

# COMBAT PATROL: ADEPTUS CUSTODES

# GUARDIANS OF THE THRONE

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Guardians of the Throne can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Martial Ka’tah – that is referenced on many units’ datasheets, and is described below.

Your Shield-Captain model is your Warlord and has the Auramite Thunderbolt Enhancement. You can replace this with Blade of the Vaults.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# MARTIAL KA’TAH

Created deep in the Emperor’s Palace using esoteric gene-alchemies and other, even more mysterious processes, the warriors of the Adeptus Custodes are the Emperor’s personal bodyguards. Known as the Ten Thousand, they are the most elite warriors in the entire Imperium, and are armed and armoured to match. In battle, they deploy highly flexible fighting forces, from peerless infantry and lightning-fast jetbikes to indomitable combat walkers and line-shattering battle tanks. It is in melee combat that they truly excel, however, each warrior having mastered the nuanced and subtle fighting stances designed to dominate the Custodians’ many enemies.

# AURAMITE THUNDERBOLT

This warrior is a swift and terrible foe to all those who would threaten the sanctity of the Golden Throne. They descend upon their victims with terrible swiftness and strike before they can react to their onset.

You can re-roll Advance and Charge rolls made for the bearer’s unit.

# Ka’tah Stances

At the start of the Fight phase, select one Ka’tah Stance from the list below to be active for your army until the end of the phase. While a Ka’tah Stance is active for your army, each unit from your army with this ability gains the relevant ability.

# DACATARAI STANCE

This aggressive fighting style has been adapted for the Custodes to deal with hordes of foes who vastly outnumber them.

Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

# RENDAX STANCE

Masters of Rendax are superlative monster and war-machine hunters.

Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# BLADE OF THE VAULTS

The Adeptus Custodes have unparalleled access to the ancient relic weapons held in the armoured vaults deep beneath the Imperial Palace on Terra. This is such a weapon, crafted in an age of impossible antiquity to be the bane of its victims.

Each time the bearer makes an attack, on a Critical Wound, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# GUARDIAN OF THE REALM

It is the duty of the Adeptus Custodes to safeguard the future of Terra and, by extension, Mankind’s eternal realm. Those who threaten it must be struck down without mercy, and the sacred territories they have falsely claimed returned to their true master.

At the end of each phase, you score 1VP if your Shield-Captain model destroyed one or more enemy models that phase. If any of those enemy models’ units started that phase within range of an objective marker, you score 2VP instead.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# DRIVE THE TALONS DEEP

The enemy strive to hold back the Talons of the Emperor, seeking to protect some accursed facility or shield some heretical demagogue that is the Custodians’ true target. Their lines must be shattered. Their efforts must be proved hopeless in the face of Terra’s vengeance, for in this way is a message sent and an example made.

The Adeptus Custodes drive their foes before them, relentlessly dogging their heels as they run their quarry to ground and destroy them utterly.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your opponent’s turn, you score 3VP if one or more Adeptus Custodes units from your army (excluding Battle-shocked units) are wholly within your opponent’s deployment zone.

# STRATAGEMS
