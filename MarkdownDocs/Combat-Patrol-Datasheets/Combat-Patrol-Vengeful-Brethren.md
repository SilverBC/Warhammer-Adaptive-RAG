# The Vengeful Brethren - Intercessor Squad

# The Vengeful Brethren

# Intercessor Squad (10 Models)

- Every model is equipped with:
- bolt pistol
- bolt rifle
- close combat weapon

# Master Zacharial (1 Model)

- This model is equipped with:
- boltstorm gauntlet
- power fist
- relic chainsword

As far as characters go, few are as durable as a Captain in Gravis armour. Master Zacharial is able to cut his way through large swathes of the foe, but must be protected from the enemy’s more powerful guns. As such, be sure to use intervening scenery to keep him hidden from such firepower until the time comes to pile him into his chosen target.

The Intercessor Squad can be split into two separate units using the Patrol Squads rule. This gives you two Battleline units, making for a greater degree of flexibility when it comes to securing objectives. However, keeping your Intercessors as a single unit does increase the effectiveness of Stratagems such as Relic Munitions, making such a decision far from automatic. To guide your decision, be sure to take a look at your opponent’s army before the battle begins to judge whether you need to focus more on objectives or dealing damage.# Warhammer 40K Unit Information

# Warhammer 40K Unit Information

# BLADEGUARD VETERAN SQUAD (3 MODELS)

- Every model is equipped with:
- heavy bolt pistol
- master-crafted power weapon

# HELLBLASTER SQUAD (5 MODELS)

- Every model is equipped with:
- bolt pistol
- plasma incinerator
- close combat weapon

The Hellblasters are an incredibly versatile ranged unit, able to effectively deal with some of your opponent’s most heavily armoured infantry. To ensure that you use them to full effectiveness, make sure to keep them well away from any enemy units that might tie them up in combat, as this will prevent them from using their plasma incinerators until they fight their way free.

This unit is the most durable portion of your force, with a good invulnerable save making it possible for them to take even the mightiest of blows and still have a chance to keep going. They are also superlative melee fighters, able to switch between improved damage output and extra durability each turn. Pushing these warriors into the centre of the enemy lines and forcing your opponent to react to the threat they pose is rarely a bad strategy.# Combat Patrol - The Vengeful Brethren

# COMBAT PATROL

# THE VENGEFUL BRETHREN

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use the Vengeful Brethren can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all of the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Oath of Moment – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet and is described below.

Your Captain model has the Determined Combatant Enhancement. You can replace this with the Wages of Retribution.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# OATH OF MOMENT

In battle, Space Marines swear mighty oaths to destroy the enemies of the Emperor and uphold the honour of their Chapter, and such vows are sacrosanct. When the Angels of Death strike, they do so with the precision of a surgeon and the force of a thunderbolt. Experience and strategic expertise help them to read the shifting shape of the battle with post-human speed and clarity, directing their wrath towards one priority target after another. Command assets are annihilated, leaving the enemy reeling leaderless. Heavy armour, potent artillery and the vaunted elites of the foe’s forces are laid waste with horrifying speed, until the Emperor’s Angels of Death stand victorious over a field of smouldering wreckage and bolt-riddled corpses, and honour is finally satisfied.

# DETERMINED COMBATANT

An exemplar of the Dark Angels’ relentless dedication to duty, once this warrior has set their mind to taking and holding a location they strike down any who oppose them with cold fury.

While the bearer is within range of an objective marker, weapons equipped by the bearer have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

# Oath of Moment Targeting

At the start of your Command phase, select one unit from your opponent’s army. Until the start of your next Command phase, that enemy unit is your Oath of Moment target. Each time a model with this ability makes an attack that targets your Oath of Moment target, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# WAGES OF RETRIBUTION

The battle-brothers of the Unforgiven Chapters may not always know why a particular foe has been marked above all others for destruction or capture, for their superiors make a habit of secrecy. Yet it is enough to know they have done their duty, for in their Primarch’s own words, duty is its own reward.

Each time an Adeptus Astartes model from your army destroys your Oath of Moment target, if the bearer is on the battlefield, roll one D6: on a 4+, you gain 1CP.

# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# HUNTERS OF HERETICS

Not only does cutting down their foes’ greatest champions do honour to the Emperor and the Primarch, but it also serves to shatter enemy morale and cement the Dark Angels’ victory.

- Each time an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army destroys an enemy Character model, you score 5VP.
- At the end of the battle, if all enemy Character models are destroyed, you score 5VP.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# TAKE THE STRONGHOLD

The enemies of the Emperor must be dug out of every bolthole and tainted strongpoint, driven from their heretical fastnesses and subjected to the merciless judgement of the Unforgiven.

Before the battle, at the start of the Deploy Armies step, your opponent must select one objective marker that is not in their deployment zone.

At the end of your turn, you score 5VP if you control that selected objective marker.

# STRATAGEMS

# UNYIELDING

So stubborn and stoic are the Dark Angels that even death is not enough to stay their wrath.
