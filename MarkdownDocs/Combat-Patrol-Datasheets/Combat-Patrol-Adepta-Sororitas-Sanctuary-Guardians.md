# Warhammer 40K - Sanctuary Guardians

# Sanctuary Guardians

# Battle Sisters Squad (10 Models)

- The Sister Superior is equipped with: bolt pistol; combi-weapon; power weapon.
- 1 Battle Sister is equipped with: bolt pistol; Ministorum flamer; close combat weapon.
- 1 Battle Sister is equipped with: bolt pistol; Ministorum heavy flamer; close combat weapon.
- 1 Battle Sister is equipped with: bolt pistol; boltgun; close combat weapon; simulacrum imperialis.
- 6 Battle Sisters are equipped with: bolt pistol; boltgun; close combat weapon.

# Canoness Adalya (1 Model)

- This model is equipped with: condemnor boltgun; hallowed chainsword; null rod.

Your Canoness model can lead either the Battle Sisters or the Celestian Sacresants, and she brings some excellent synergy to both. If attached to the Battle Sisters Squad, the Defender of the Faith Enhancement can be a big boost to the unit’s survivability, which is particularly beneficial if the unit is not split into separate Patrol Squads.

However, her ability to re-roll Hit rolls, coupled with the Ascetic Discipline Stratagem, can also make her a very effective leader of the Celestian Sacresants, enabling them to achieve a lot more Lethal Hits with their hallowed maces. This is very effective when targeting enemy Monsters or Vehicles, and also improves their ability to leap out from hiding and pounce on the enemy.

However, this comes at the disadvantage of reducing the effectiveness of your Stratagems upon these smaller units, with fewer models in each unit to receive the benefits. If your opponent has a lot of smaller units that threaten to outmanoeuvre your force, you may well find this downside outweighed by the flexibility that splitting your unit offers.# Warhammer 40K - Unit Information


# ARCO‑FLAGELLANTS (10 MODELS)

- Every model is equipped with: arco‑flails.

With their high volume of melee attacks, the Arco‑flagellants are able to inflict wounds on a wide variety of targets by brute force. This also makes the Ascetic Discipline Stratagem particularly effective on this unit, helping to offset their arco‑flails’ lack of Armour Penetration when fighting against heavily armoured foes.

The Arco‑flagellants’ Wounds characteristic of 2 also makes them particularly durable against small arms fire, but watch out for elite enemy units with weapons of Damage 3 or higher, as these can quickly chew through this unit in spite of its Feel No Pain ability.

# CELESTIAN SACRESANTS (5 MODELS)

- Every model is equipped with: bolt pistol; hallowed mace.

This unit, alongside the Arco‑flagellants, represent the hardest hitting elements of the force. While the Arco‑flagellants are a fairly blunt instrument, overwhelming the enemy with their sheer number of attacks and relying on the Feel No Pain ability for resilience, the Celestian Sacresants are a somewhat more nuanced unit.

Armed with hallowed maces, these models are particularly adept at taking on armoured enemies with multiple wounds, and as such it is critical to avoid them getting pinned down by less ideal targets, as their comparatively low number of attacks may prevent them from breaking free. While they have an excellent invulnerable save, if they get caught in the open and do not have a Canoness leading them to benefit from their Sworn Protectors ability, you should consider using the Holy Radiance Stratagem, which can really help them weather massed small arms fire.# Warhammer 40K - Combat Patrol: Sanctuary Guardians

# SANCTUARY GUARDIANS

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use the Sanctuary Guardians can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Acts of Faith – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

Your Canoness model is your Warlord and has the Defender of the Faith Enhancement. You can replace this with Righteous Fury.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# ACTS OF FAITH

It is said the Emperor’s benediction touches the Adepta Sororitas, manifesting as a nimbus of holy light in which his power is revealed in miraculous deeds of fortitude and divine strength.

# DEFENDER OF THE FAITH

This commander has served in many Wars of Faith and by the Emperor’s grace has survived against the odds. In her presence is the faith and resolve of the Sisterhood empowered and their resilience enhanced.

Each unit from your army can perform one Act of Faith per phase. This is done using Miracle dice.

# Gaining Miracle Dice

You gain 1 Miracle dice:

- At the start of each turn.
- Each time an Adepta Sororitas unit from your army is destroyed.
- Improve the Save characteristic of models in the bearer’s unit by 1.
- In your Command phase, you can discard 1 Miracle dice. If you do, until the start of your next Command phase, add 1 to the Objective Control characteristic of models in the bearer’s unit.

Each time you gain a Miracle dice, roll one D6. The number you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This value cannot be changed or re‑rolled, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice to one side – this is your Miracle dice pool.

# Performing an Act of Faith

Before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a Charge roll or Battle‑shock test, only a single dice can be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled (this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# RIGHTEOUS FURY

This commander is a true warrior of the faith. She leads her warriors in furious charges, covering the ground with a speed borne of zealous hatred.

- The bearer’s unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a turn in which it Advanced or Fell Back.
- In your Command phase, you can discard 1 Miracle dice. If you do, until the end of the turn, you can re‑roll Charge rolls made for the bearer’s unit.

# Types of Dice Rolls

- Advance roll
- Battle‑shock test
- Charge roll
- Damage roll
- Hit roll
- Saving throw
- Wound roll

# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# Hallowed Retribution

The enemies of the Imperial Creed must be purged. Only with the slaughter of the faithless can the sanctity of the Imperium be protected.

You score 3VP each time an Adepta Sororitas unit from your army destroys an enemy unit. If that unit from your army performed an Act of Faith this phase, you score 4VP instead.

# Optional Secondary Objective

# Consecrated Ground

Sweeping aside their foes, the Adepta Sororitas advance into the heart of the battlefield, chanting prayers and dispensing clouds of incense to consecrate the territory they have seized.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your turn, you score 3VP if one or more Adepta Sororitas units from your army (excluding Battle‑shocked units) are within 6" of the centre of the battlefield. If one of those units is your Warlord, you score 4VP instead.

# STRATAGEMS

# Ascetic Discipline

# Sanctuary Guardians – Battle Tactic Stratagem

The Sisters of the Adepta Sororitas whisper mantras of concentration as they aim their boltguns towards the foe.

- WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase.
- TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes an attack, on a Critical Wound, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 2.

Cost: 1CP

# A Martyr’s Death

Each and every Sister strives to strike one last blow against their foe before death claims them.

- WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.
- TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
- EFFECT: Each time you use this Stratagem, you can discard 1 Miracle dice. Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that model has not shot or fought this phase, roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if you discarded a Miracle dice when using this Stratagem. On a 4+, do not remove the destroyed model from play; it can shoot or fight after the attacking unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.

Cost: 1CP

# Holy Radiance

The Emperor’s holy light illuminates these Sisters, its radiant aura bestowing upon them resilience just as it blinds the enemy with its shimmering brilliance.

- WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.
- TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, subtract 1 from the Hit roll and models in your unit have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability against that attack.
