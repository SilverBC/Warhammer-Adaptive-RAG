# COMBAT PATROL: WORLD EATERS

# KARAGAR’S RAMPAGERS

The World Eaters warband of Karagar the Blooded have been the terror of a score of worlds through the Laervold Belt and beyond. How they travel from battlefield to battlefield is unclear, but rumours persist of unholy portals formed from swirling blood-tides that rise from the butchered bodies of their victims. They care for nothing but killing in the Blood God’s name, piling heaped skulls high and leaving charnel destruction in their wake.

# COMBAT PATROL: WORLD EATERS

# KARAGAR’S RAMPAGERS

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Karagar’s Rampagers can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Blessings of Khorne – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

Your Lord on Juggernaut model is your Warlord and has the Skulls for Khorne Enhancement. You can replace this with Arch-slaughterer.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# BLESSINGS OF KHORNE

Khorne is the god of warfare and slaughter, and provides for those who consecrate the battlefield in his name.

At the start of the battle round, you can make a Blessings of Khorne roll. To do so, roll eight D6. You can then use those dice to activate up to two Blessings of Khorne from the Blessings of Khorne list (see below). Each Blessing of Khorne specifies the dice results it requires (where a number is specified, a double or triple of that value or higher is required). You can only activate each Blessing of Khorne once per battle round. Any unused dice from the Blessings of Khorne roll are then discarded.

# SKULLS FOR KHORNE

The tenets of the Blood God are as singular as they are uncompromising – the heads of worthy foes must be struck from their necks and their skulls offered up in tribute. With such carnal trophies do his champions believe they honour their wrathful god.

Each time the bearer destroys an enemy unit with a melee attack, roll one D6: on a 2+, you gain 1CP.

Once activated, each Blessing of Khorne applies to all units from your army until the end of the battle round.

# Blessings of Khorne List

|Blessing|Activation Requirement|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Wrathful Devotion|Any double|Models in this unit have the Feel No Pain 6+ ability. If models in this unit already have the Feel No Pain ability, add 1 to their Feel No Pain rolls.|
|Total Carnage|Double 4+ or any triple|Each time a model in this unit is destroyed by a melee attack, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6: on a 4+, do not remove it from play. The destroyed model can fight after the attacking model’s unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.|
|Warp Blades|Double 5+ or any triple|Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.|

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# ARCH-SLAUGHTERER

Every blow this dark champion lands upon their enemies is expertly aimed to inflict the maximum damage. With a few strokes, they dismember even the greatest enemies like butchered livestock.

Melee weapons equipped by the bearer have the [PRECISION] ability.

# Example

Ash makes their Blessings of Khorne roll and gets the following dice: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6. First they use the two 6s to activate Warp Blades (which requires a double 5+), leaving the following dice: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4.

They then use the two 2s to activate Wrathful Devotion (which requires any double), leaving the following dice: 1, 2, 3, 4. However, now that they have activated two Blessings of Khorne, they cannot activate any more and the remaining dice are discarded.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Information


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

You will use the Ravage and Ransack secondary objective. You can replace this with Blood Offering.

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# RAVAGE AND RANSACK

Like a ferocious barbarian horde, the World Eaters rip apart their enemies’ strongholds and smash irreplaceable equipment and relics. They murder not just the foe themselves, but also everything they are and all they hold dear.

At the end of your opponent’s turn, you score 4VP if you control the objective marker closest to your opponent’s battlefield edge.

# STRATAGEMS

You can use the following Stratagems:

# RAGE UNCHECKED

# KARAGAR’S RAMPAGERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Those who strike at the World Eaters but fail to kill them outright only serve to further enrage the survivors and, by their bloody hand, ensure their own destruction.

- WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase.
- COST: 1CP
- TARGET: One Berzerkers unit from your army that is Below Half-strength and has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

# UNSTOPPABLE FURY

# KARAGAR’S RAMPAGERS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

As the Butchers’ Nails thunder in their brains, the World Eaters rampage ever deeper into the enemy lines and smash aside every impediment.

- WHEN: Fight phase, just before a World Eaters unit from your army Consolidates.
- COST: 1CP
- TARGET: That World Eaters unit.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes a Consolidation move, it can move up to 6" instead of up to 3", provided your unit ends that Consolidation move within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.

# OVERWHELMING ONSLAUGHT

# KARAGAR’S RAMPAGERS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# BLOOD OFFERING

Khorne, it is said, cares not from where the blood flows. The battlefield is the only altar required to offer crimson sacrament to such a monstrous deity.

You score 2VP each time a World Eaters model from your army destroys an enemy unit with a melee attack if that enemy unit started the phase within range of an objective marker.

The sheer terrifying ferocity of World Eaters on the charge is enough to hurl even the most resolute foes into disarray or paralyse them with unreasoning fear.

- WHEN: Your Charge phase, just after a World Eaters unit from your army ends a Charge move.
- COST: 1CP
- TARGET: That World Eaters unit.
- EFFECT: Select one enemy unit within Engagement Range of your unit. That enemy unit must take a Battle-shock test and when doing so, subtract 1 from the result.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

So blood-drenched a path has Karagar carved between the stars that he has earned in reward a daemonic steed known as a Juggernaut. Part brass-shod war engine, part sentient battering ram, this monster bears Karagar into battle and crushes his foes beneath its trampling hooves.

Berzerkers of Khorne relish their role as the Blood God’s sacred destroyers, and are fanatical in the extreme. The warp-fuelled anger of these psychopathic warriors drives them into an endless frenzy of action. Those who face them in battle disappear under a rain of heavy blows, each potent enough to shear limbs and shatter shields.

Jakhals are amongst the strongest and most bloodthirsty of all the mortal followers of the World Eaters, and seek to emulate their gore-crazed masters in every way they can. When sent into battle, they enter the fray with wild abandon, hacking and slashing with their chain weapons in the hope of earning the favour of their lords.
