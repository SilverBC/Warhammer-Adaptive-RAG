# Siguard’s Crusaders

# Abilities

The datasheets required to use Siguard’s Crusaders can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Oath of Moment – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

# Oath of Moment

In battle, Space Marines swear mighty oaths to destroy the enemies of the Emperor and uphold the honour of their Chapter, and such vows are sacrosanct. When the Angels of Death strike, they do so with the precision of a surgeon and the force of a thunderbolt. Experience and strategic expertise help them to read the shifting shape of the battle with post-human speed and clarity, directing their wrath towards one priority target after another. Command assets are annihilated, leaving the enemy reeling leaderless. Heavy armour, potent artillery and the vaunted elites of the foe’s forces are laid waste with horrifying speed, until the Emperor’s Angels of Death stand victorious over a field of smouldering wreckage and bolt-riddled corpses, and honour is finally satisfied.

Your Marshal model is your Warlord and has the Crusaders’ Fervour Enhancement. You can replace this with Righteous Defiance.

# Default Enhancement

# Crusaders’ Fervour

The religious fervour and self-righteous ferocity of the Black Templars are legendary. When focused upon the foe by a sufficiently charismatic leader, these traits become weapons in their own right.

- Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of melee weapons equipped by models in the bearer’s unit.

# Oath of Moment Targeting

At the start of your Command phase, select one unit from your opponent’s army. Until the start of your next Command phase, that enemy unit is your Oath of Moment target. Each time a model with this ability makes an attack that targets your Oath of Moment target, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

# Optional Enhancement

# Righteous Defiance

Such is the strength of this warrior’s conviction in the righteousness of his cause that he can – by sheer inflexible force of will – shrug off even the most grievous hurts. Moreover, his mere presence is enough to inspire his battle-brothers to follow his example.

- The bearer has the Feel No Pain 5+ ability. In addition, once per battle, when the bearer’s unit is selected as the target of an attack, it can use this ability. If it does, until the end of the phase, models in the bearer’s unit have the Feel No Pain 4+ ability.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# PATH OF PURGATION

The bloody path to victory in the God-Emperor’s name leads ever onward into the heart of the enemy’s ranks. On that road the faithful warrior will never run short of foes to slay nor heretics to smite.

At the end of the battle, you score 8VP if one or more Adeptus Astartes units from your army (excluding Battle-shocked units) are within your opponent’s deployment zone. If your Warlord is not Battle-shocked and is wholly within your opponent’s deployment zone, you score 10VP instead.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# SACRED VOW

Since their earliest days it has been the way of the Black Templars to swear great and binding vows before battle. It is a mark of great and proven faith to fulfil these pious oaths in the sight of one’s battle-brothers.

From the second battle round onwards, at the start of the battle round, select one enemy unit that is not destroyed to be your army’s target that battle round. At the end of that battle round, you score 3VP if your army’s target for that battle round was destroyed by a melee attack made by an Adeptus Astartes model from your army. If that Adeptus Astartes model has the Primaris Crusader Squad keyword, you score 4VP instead.

# STRATAGEMS

# SHIELD OF ZEAL

SIGUARD’S CRUSADERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

When prosecuting the foe at close quarters, the zealous aggression of the Black Templars reaches such fever pitch that they can simply ignore pain and even severe injury.

- WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.
- COST: 1CP
- TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes Infantry unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, if the attacking model is within 6" of your unit, models in your unit have a 4+ invulnerable save against that attack. Primaris Neophyte models have a 5+ invulnerable save against that attack instead.

# HATE-FUELLED STRENGTH

SIGUARD’S CRUSADERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The Black Templars’ disgust for the heresies of their foes lends punishing might to their blows.

- WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase.
- COST: 1CP
- TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes Infantry unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes an attack that targets the closest eligible target, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

# GOADED TO FURY

SIGUARD’S CRUSADERS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

To fire upon the Black Templars is to stoke their outrage that the enemies of Mankind would dare raise arms against the God-Emperor’s chosen warriors. Their response is typically as aggressive as it is immediate.

- WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has shot.
- COST: 1CP
- TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes Infantry unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
- EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal move, but must end that move as close as possible to that enemy unit.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet
