# COMBAT PATROL: CHAOS SPACE MARINES

# DARK ZEALOTS

This force of Chaos Space Marines is balanced and versatile, able to engage the foe at close quarters or in punishing firefights. This is well, for the fanatical Dark Apostle Ghallaron the Pious leads them into the most ferocious and varied war zones in his never-ending quest to offer praise to the Chaos Gods. His warriors follow him into the flames willingly enough, for they believe that by allying themselves to one so blessed by the Dark Gods, they too will receive the boons of the Chaos pantheon.

# Unit Information

Havocs are a type of unit in the Warhammer 40K universe, known for their heavy weaponry and ability to provide long-range fire support.

Number of Models: 2# Combat Patrol: Chaos Space Marines - Dark Zealots

# COMBAT PATROL: CHAOS SPACE MARINES

# DARK ZEALOTS

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use the Dark Zealots can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Dark Pacts – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

# DARK PACTS

Beseeching the Chaos Gods with fanatical fervour, the profane champions of the Heretic Astartes pray for diabolic boons, promising the vilest of offerings in return for their power.

Each time a unit from your army is selected to shoot or fight, it can make a Dark Pact. If it does, select one of the following abilities for that unit’s weapons to gain until the end of the phase:

- [LETHAL HITS]
- [SUSTAINED HITS 1]

Each time a unit makes a Dark Pact, after it has resolved its attacks, it must take a Leadership test; if that test is failed, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

Your Dark Apostle model is your Warlord and has the Hateful Exhortation Enhancement. You can replace this with Infernal Blessing.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# HATEFUL EXHORTATION

With baleful rhetoric and the promise of dark rewards, this warrior goads their followers to persecute their chosen foe with single-minded cruelty.

At the start of the first battle round, select one enemy unit. Until the end of the battle, each time a model in the bearer’s unit makes an attack that targets that enemy unit, on a Critical Wound, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# INFERNAL BLESSING

Calling upon the empyric boons of the Dark Gods, this warrior beseeches them to preserve his mortal form. Wounds reknit with ghastly sucking sounds. Scorched flesh regrows into hardened scales or glimmering crystal. Severed limbs sprout anew as mutant appendages. The long term effects upon the traitor’s body and mind may be terrible, but the immediate benefits in the heat of battle are clear.

The bearer has the Feel No Pain 5+ ability.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# CHAMPION OF THE DARK GODS

With every foe that falls by his hand, the Dark Apostle howls out praises to the Octed. With the spilled blood of his enemies he anoints the battlefield in the Chaos Gods’ dread names.

At the end of each phase, you score 3VP if your Dark Apostle model destroyed one or more enemy models that phase.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# IDOLATROUS DESPOILERS

It is the singular mission of these Chaos worshippers to smash aside the fools who bar their path and push on into the heartlands of the enemy faith. There they can tear down their enemies’ icons and raise monstrous idols to the Dark Gods in their place.

At the end of your opponent’s turn, you score 4VP if one or more units from your army (excluding Battle-shocked units) are wholly within your opponent’s deployment zone.

# STRATAGEMS

# EMPYRIC RITES

Invoking the names of daemonic patrons, the Heretic Astartes ward away enemy attacks.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

COST: 1CP

TARGET: One Heretic Astartes Infantry unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, models in your unit have a 4+ invulnerable save.

# BITTER BLOWS

Fuelled by twisted faith and undying hatred, these warriors strike out with spiteful fury even as they are cut down.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

COST: 1CP

TARGET: One Heretic Astartes Infantry unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6: on a 4+, do not remove it from play. The destroyed model can fight after the attacking model’s unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.

# MALICIOUS VOLLEYS

Veterans of the Long War, these warriors know precisely where to place their shots to inflict the most pain and misery on their luckless victims.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

COST: 1CP

TARGET: One Heretic Astartes Infantry unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes an attack, re-roll a Hit roll of 1. If that attack targets a unit that is Below Half-strength, you can re-roll the Hit roll instead.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

Possessed of infernal fanatical fervour, Ghallaron the Pious is a demagogue of the Chaos Gods. This Dark Apostle bellows heretical prayers that inspire his fellow warriors, wreathe them in cloaking shadows or gift them with unnaturally sharp senses.

Against the onslaught of Chaos Legionaries, few can stand for long. Whether millennia-old veterans of the Long War or traitors from renegade warbands, Legionaries are deadly and adaptable warriors, unleashing streams of explosive bolts or venting their vicious hatred with swings of rending chainswords.

Helbrutes are walking engines of destruction and psychosis, their occupants kept alive in a state of agony and insanity. These infernal sarcophagi are fitted with a variety of powerful armaments to blast enemy armour open from afar, or cruel appendages with which to hack and crush with enormous strength at close range.
