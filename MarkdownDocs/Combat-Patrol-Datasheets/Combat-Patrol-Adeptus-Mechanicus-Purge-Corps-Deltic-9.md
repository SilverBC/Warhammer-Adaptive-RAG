# Warhammer 40K - Purge Corps Deltic-9

# PURGE CORPS DELTIC-9

# SERBERYS SULPHURHOUNDS (3 MODELS)

- The Serberys Sulphurhound Alpha model is equipped with:
- Mechanicus pistol
- sulphur breath
- cavalry arc maul
- clawed limbs
- 1 Serberys Sulphurhound model is equipped with:
- phosphor blast carbine
- phosphor pistol
- sulphur breath
- clawed limbs
- 1 Serberys Sulphurhound model is equipped with:
- 2 phosphor pistols
- sulphur breath
- clawed limbs

# PTERAXII STERYLIZORS (5 MODELS)

- The Pteraxii Sterylizor Alpha model is equipped with:
- flechette blaster
- taser goad
- Every Pteraxii Sterylizor model is equipped with:
- phosphor torch
- Pteraxii talons

The Pteraxii Sterylizors are a very potent unit, whether you deploy them by Deep Strike or start them on the battlefield and use their excellent mobility to claim key locations early on. The number of Torrent weapons they wield makes them prime candidates for the Fire Overwatch Stratagem, while using the An Evaluation of Mettle Stratagem to give them the Feel No Pain 5+ ability is a great way to enhance their survivability.

The fast movement and large base size of the Serberys Sulphurhounds can be very useful for establishing a large area of control on the battlefield, as well as for intercepting enemies seeking to punish your more fragile Skitarii Vanguard in melee. Fearsome combatants though the Sulphurhounds are, keep in mind that they too are not the most durable of units, so don’t be afraid to use the mere threat of them to keep your opponent away, rather than running them out into the open too early on.# Warhammer 40K - Skitarii Units


# MANIPULUS SKAND (1 MODEL)

- This model is equipped with: transonic cannon; Omnissian staff.

This model makes an excellent Leader for the Skitarii Vanguard. As well as granting all of their attacks
[LETHAL HITS], his Enhancements allow you to really tailor the unit’s role on the battlefield.
If you expect the unit to suffer a lot of enemy attention, you will likely want to retain the Aspergilla of
Tarentum, which helps to offset the low Toughness of the Vanguard and keep them alive for longer.
However, if you are facing a less durable foe concerned with escaping your own firepower, the
Overcharged Electropositors Enhancement is a very effective choice, granting the Vanguard’s firearms
added range and the [IGNORES COVER] ability.

# SKITARII VANGUARD (10 MODELS)

- The Skitarii Vanguard Alpha model is equipped with: Mechanicus pistol; Alpha combat weapon.
- 1 Skitarii Vanguard model is equipped with: arc rifle; close combat weapon.
- 1 Skitarii Vanguard model is equipped with: plasma caliver; close combat weapon.
- 7 Skitarii Vanguard models are equipped with: radium carbine; close combat weapon.

Coupled with their Battleline keyword, the Skitarii Vanguard’s Rad-saturation ability makes them a very
aggressive objective-holding unit, but they are quite vulnerable to enemy attacks. Should the unit become
locked in combat, it is highly advisable to use the Optimised Efficiency Stratagem to disengage them,
before turning their aggression back upon the enemy with ranged attacks.# Combat Patrol - Purge Corps Deltic-9

# COMBAT PATROL

# PURGE CORPS DELTIC-9

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Purge Corps Deltic-9 can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This may include a Faction ability – Doctrina Imperatives – which is described below.

# DOCTRINA IMPERATIVES

An Adeptus Mechanicus army marching to war is a sight both terrifying and glorious, each holy warrior a disturbing fusion of Human and machine. The ruling Tech-Priests and their fanatical followers raise modified voices in praise of the Machine God, controlling their cyborg soldiery and mechanical creations through doctrina imperatives encoded to augment and adapt the warriors’ abilities.

Your Tech-Priest Manipulus model is your Warlord and has the Aspergilla of Tarentum Enhancement. You can replace this with Overcharged Electropositors.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# ASPERGILLA OF TARENTUM

These gilded vents upon the Tech-Priest’s hunched upper carapace enable them to disperse a spray of holy unguent over the faithful, diffused in a greasy mist. The sanctified substance coats thick robes and exposed bionics alike in a viscous layer that bleeds potential energy from incoming attacks.

At the start of the battle round, you can select one of the Doctrina Imperatives below. Until the end of the battle round, that Doctrina Imperative is active for your army, and all units from your army that have the Doctrina Imperatives ability gain the relevant abilities shown below. Each time an attack targets the bearer’s unit, subtract 1 from the Wound roll.

# PROTECTOR IMPERATIVE

- Ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [HEAVY] ability.
- Each time a ranged attack targets this unit, if this unit is within your deployment zone, worsen the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

# CONQUEROR IMPERATIVE

- Ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [ASSAULT] ability.
- Each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack, if the target of that attack is within your opponent’s deployment zone, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

# OR

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# OVERCHARGED ELECTROPOSITORS

Drawing on reserves of the holy Motive Force, the Tech-Priest infuses their nest of coiling electropositors so that they thrum with overcharged power. With this potential energy, they invigorate their servants’ weapons with the power and reach to cut down the Machine God’s enemies wherever they hide.

Add 6" to the Range characteristic of ranged weapons equipped by models in the bearer’s unit, and those weapons have the [IGNORES COVER] ability.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# STRATAGEMS

You will use the Targeted Purge secondary objective. You can replace this with Prescribed Excoriation.

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# AN EVALUATION OF METTLE

# PURGE CORPS DELTIC-9 – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

# TARGETED PURGE

In a binharic decree, an enemy of the Omnissiah has been designated for priority purgation. The proof of their flesh and blood frailty and their existence as a weak link amongst the foe must be forged swiftly and unequivocally.

At the start of the first battle round, your opponent must select one unit from their army (excluding Monster and Vehicle units).

At the end of the battle, you score 12VP if that unit is destroyed.

# OPTIMISED EFFICIENCY

# PURGE CORPS DELTIC-9 – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# PRESCRIBED EXCORIATION

The enemy have broken through in this region, but they must be contained, lest they gain a foothold in which to funnel ever more troops. As the Omnissiah’s legions gather to mount a full-scale counterattack, the foe must first be delayed or driven back, no matter the cost to the Tech-Priest’s willing servants.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your turn, you score 3VP if there are no enemy units within your deployment zone (excluding Battle-shocked units). If there are no enemy units within 6" of your deployment zone (excluding Battle-shocked units), you score 5VP instead.

# ACCEPTABLE RISK RATIO

# PURGE CORPS DELTIC-9 – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

In an emotionless calculus of war, the Machine God’s warriors are tasked to unburden their weapons of fail-safes and overcharge limits. The risk to the weapons’ wielders is deemed insignificant when weighed against the potential for greater immediate carnage amongst the foe.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

TARGET: One Adeptus Mechanicus unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of ranged weapons equipped by models in your unit by 1 and those weapons have the [HAZARDOUS] ability.

The hyper-irradiated shot unleashed by the Skitarii Vanguard’s carbines ensure those that would otherwise survive the injury still sicken and die. Vanguard are infused with this radiation, emitting a debilitating aura they themselves are inured to. This hardens them to fight in the most toxic war zones to defend the Tech-Priests’ interests.

Sulphurhound cavalry squadrons are aggressive shock troops and line-breakers.

Streylizors are eradicators of cybernetic parasite organisms within ships and manufactorums, and eagerly unleash the chemical fire of their phosphor torches upon the Machine God’s foes.
