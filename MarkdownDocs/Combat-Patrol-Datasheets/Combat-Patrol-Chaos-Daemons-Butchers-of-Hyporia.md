# Warhammer 40K Tabletop Game

# Introduction

Warhammer 40K is a tabletop miniature wargame produced by Games Workshop. Players assemble and paint their own armies of miniatures and engage in battles on a tabletop battlefield.

The rules of Warhammer 40K are extensive and cover various aspects of gameplay, including movement, shooting, and combat. Below are some key rules:

# Movement

Units can move a certain distance based on their movement attribute. Players measure the distance using a measuring tape.

# Shooting

When shooting, players roll a number of dice based on the unit's weapon profile. The results determine if the attack hits and how much damage is inflicted.

# Combat

In close combat, players roll dice to determine the outcome of attacks. The results are compared against the opponent's defense.

# COMBAT PATROL: CHAOS DAEMONS

# BUTCHERS OF HYPORIA

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use the Butchers of Hyporia can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – The Shadow of Chaos – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

Your Bloodmaster model is your Warlord and has the Incarnated Rage Enhancement. You can replace this with Warp Locus.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# THE SHADOW OF CHAOS

When daemons pour into realspace, maelstroms of warp energy spill through in their wake. Manifest emotion and unbridled, nightmarish forces twist all that they touch, reshaping the landscape into bizarre forms while tormenting mortal beings to madness. To be embroiled in such tempests is to endure conditions utterly anathema to the fundamental laws of reality, provoking primal terror in even the most emotionless warriors.

# Certain areas of the battlefield are considered to be within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, as follows:

- Your deployment zone is always within your army’s Shadow of Chaos.
- At the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers within No Man’s Land, until the end of that phase, No Man’s Land is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos.
- At the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers within your opponent’s deployment zone, until the end of that phase, your opponent’s deployment zone is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos.

# Daemonic Manifestation

While a unit from your army is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, each time that unit takes a Battle-shock test, add 1 to that test and, if that test is passed, one model in that unit regains up to D3 lost wounds (if that unit is a Battleline unit and that test is passed, up to D3 destroyed models can be returned to that unit instead).

# Daemonic Terror

While an enemy unit is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, each time that unit takes a Battle-shock test, subtract 1 from that test and, if that test is failed, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

# OR

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# WARP LOCUS (AURA)

So powerful is this daemon’s manifestation upon the fabric of realspace that it burns a hole in the very skin of reality wherever it goes. Malign energies flow through it as if passing through an infernal gateway, corrupting and distorting the battlefield until it resembles Khorne’s unholy realm.

The area of the battlefield within 3" of the bearer is considered to be within your army’s Shadow of Chaos.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# WORTHY OFFERINGS

Every champion of Khorne, be they mortal or daemonic, seeks to claim the skulls of the mightiest foes to cast before the Blood God’s throne in tribute.

At the end of the battle, you score 6VP if your opponent’s Warlord is destroyed. If your opponent’s Warlord was destroyed by an attack made by your Warlord model, you score 10VP instead.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# DARK CONJUNCTION

Through frenzied and ritualistic slaughter shall the blood be shed to anoint the altar of battle. As the veil tatters and the tides of the warp spill through, Khorne’s own gore-drenched realm will manifest in realspace.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your turn, you score 1VP for each objective marker that is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos and not within your deployment zone.

# STRATAGEMS

# BLOOD-MADDENED BANISHMENT

1CP

Even as they are hurled back into the warp these daemons stab and hack, seeking to drag more mortal souls screaming into damnation alongside them.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

TARGET: One Bloodletters unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6: on a 4+, do not remove it from play. The destroyed model can fight after the attacking model’s unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.

# EMPYRIC PREDATORS

1CP

These Flesh Hounds flicker in and out of realspace, their warped howls echoing from all sides as they encircle their prey, their sulphur-wreathed forms confounding the enemy’s aim until it is far too late…

WHEN: Your opponent’s Movement phase, just after an enemy unit ends a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move.

TARGET: One Flesh Hounds unit from your army that is within 6" of that enemy unit and has not been targeted with the Fire Overwatch Stratagem this phase.

EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal move of up to 6".

RESTRICTIONS: Until the end of the phase, your unit cannot be targeted with the Fire Overwatch Stratagem.

# MANIFEST HATE

1CP

So elemental is the hatred these daemons hold for their foes that it can overcome physical wounds, reknitting their ravaged corporeal manifestations in blazes of crimson light.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, models in your unit have a 4+ invulnerable save.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

Bloodletters are hate and violence made manifest. Attacking in berserk packs or in martial, marching ranks, they hack apart their victims with monstrous hellblades. These weapons glow red-hot with the fury of their wielders, and even the slightest wound they inflict can see the victim bled dry in seconds.

Unholy fusions of daemon and machine, Juggernauts of Khorne are unstoppable beasts whose blood is fire and whose every step is thunder. When ridden into battle by Bloodletters, they act as shock cavalry, bearing down on their victims like battering rams. The destruction when their charge hits home is hideous to behold.

These hunting hounds of Khorne track the terror spoor of their prey across interstellar gulfs.
