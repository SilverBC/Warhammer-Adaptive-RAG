# Combat Patrol: Drukhari

# The Blades of Torment

Originally assembled for the terror raids on the night world of Somniad, Archon Malivex’s warriors have now fought together on numerous realspace raids. The Archon prizes swift and merciless butchery, and it is well known that he will abandon to a bloody fate any who cannot keep pace with him. As such, his followers strive constantly not only to impress their cruel master with their violent excesses, but also to ensure they never fall behind the quicksilver tempo he sets for his hit-and-run attacks.

This Combat Patrol includes the units shown below.

# COMBAT PATROL: DRUKHARI

# THE BLADES OF TORMENT

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use the Blades of Torment can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Power from Pain – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

Your Archon model is your Warlord and has the Shudderworm Bottle Enhancement. You can replace this with Spiteful Predator.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# POWER FROM PAIN

The Drukhari are experts in precise torture, sharp blades, cruel poisons and eldritch abominations. Using the labyrinthine network of webway spars, they strike almost anywhere. Realspace raiding parties prey upon worlds across the galaxy, surging from hidden portals unknown to those they see merely as cattle or playthings. As the Drukhari feed on the souls of the slain, they become imbued with supernatural might, eventually turning into killing machines.

Units from your army can become Empowered Through Pain. This is done using Pain tokens. You gain 1 Pain token:

# SHUDDERWORM BOTTLE

Within this inkglass flask writhes a neuroparasite harvested from the webway and wired into a grim invention of the Haemonculi Covens. The squealing, thrashing worm is forced to absorb the psychic soul agonies of the battlefield before vomiting them back out in waves of concentrated misery that – to nearby Drukhari – are like an invigorating tonic.

While the bearer is leading a unit, models in that unit have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability.

# Gain Pain Tokens

- At the start of the battle.
- Each time an enemy unit is destroyed.
- Each time an enemy unit fails a Battle-shock test.

Each time you gain a Pain token, keep it to one side – this is your Pain token pool.

# Using Pain Tokens

At the start of any phase, you can expend one or more Pain tokens from your Pain token pool. Each time you do, select one unit from your army with the Power from Pain ability. Until the end of the phase, that unit is Empowered, and gains the abilities listed below, depending on the phase.

- Empowered in the Movement or Charge phase: You can re-roll Advance or Charge rolls made for that unit.
- Empowered in the Shooting or Fight phase: Each time a model in that unit makes an attack, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# SPITEFUL PREDATOR

This cruel Drukhari war leader has long experience in hunting their quarry across the battlefields of realspace. They know well how to get the most out of their inhumanly swift and skilful warriors when it comes to tormenting their prey.

The bearer’s unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a turn in which it Fell Back.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# RAPACIOUS RAIDERS

Open battle is barely more than a thrilling diversion for this raiding party, who are every bit as interested in slipping past their plodding foes to raid supply lines and civilian centres for plunder and pain.

At the end of your turn, you score 3VP if one or more Drukhari units from your army (excluding Battle-shocked units) are wholly within your opponent’s deployment zone. If one or more of those units are Infantry units, you score 4VP instead.

# STRATAGEMS

# QUICKSILVER REACTIONS

# THE BLADES OF TORMENT – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The hyper-fast reflexes of the Drukhari allow them to duck and weave to avoid all but the swiftest enemy strikes.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

1CP

TARGET: One Drukhari Infantry unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.

# MANY CUTS

# THE BLADES OF TORMENT – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The denizens of Commorragh instinctively prey on the weak, delighting in picking them apart one bloody wound at a time.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase.

TARGET: One Drukhari Infantry unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase.

1CP

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability while targeting a unit that is below its Starting Strength.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# MURDEROUS MONSTER

Drukhari war leaders revel in spreading fear and horror through the ranks of their prey, making spectacularly bloody examples of their screaming victims both to magnify this effect and also to cement their position amongst their followers.

At the end of the Fight phase, you score 3VP if your Archon model destroyed one or more enemy models that phase.

# THERE AND GONE

# THE BLADES OF TORMENT – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Piratical raiders possessed of breathtaking agility and reaction speed, the Drukhari are able to spring onto and off of the decks of their anti-grav transports with incredible ease.

WHEN: End of your opponent’s Fight phase.

TARGET: One Drukhari Infantry unit from your army that is not within Engagement Range of any enemy units, and one friendly Transport model.

1CP

EFFECT: Your Infantry unit can embark within that Transport model.

RESTRICTIONS: Every model in your Infantry unit must be within 3" of that Transport model and there must be sufficient transport capacity to embark the entire unit.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

Clad from head to foot in blade-edged, segmented armour, Kabalite Warriors are an intimidating, arachnoid presence. They are highly skilled, cruel enforcers who unleash hails of toxin-coated shards during swift and agile advances, driving terrified prey before them at their master’s whim.

The Raider is a favoured transport cutter amongst the Drukhari. Its passengers loose shots from the trophy-hung decking as it speeds upon anti-grav turbines into the fighting. While its cargo of warriors leap into the fray, the Raider unleashes its heavy weaponry and flays enemies below with bladevanes.

# RAVAGER

|T|SV|W|LD|OC| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|14"|9|4+|11|6+|3|

Ravager gunships fulfil the role of armoured support during Drukhari raids, yet these grav-skiffs also possess the speed and agility to outmanoeuvre the enemy’s lumbering equivalents. They are mobile assassins, mounting enough firepower to gut enemy tanks and eradicate the foe’s elite, before swiftly moving to new hunting grounds.
