# Combat Patrol: Grey Knights

# Aurellios’ Banishers

The very nature of the wars fought by the Grey Knights often sees them vastly outnumbered by their foes, but rarely outclassed. Librarian Aurellios’ strike force is no exception, for while its warriors may seem few in number, the focused martial and spiritual might they bring to the battlefield is more than enough to see the greatest alien or daemonic abominations laid low.

This Combat Patrol includes the units shown below. Before the battle, in the Select Combat Patrol and Enhancement step, you must select either the Brotherhood Terminator Squad unit or the Nemesis Dreadknight unit to include in your Combat Patrol for the battle.

# Combat Patrol: Grey Knights

# Aurellios’ Banishers

# Abilities

The datasheets required to use Aurellios’ Banishers can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Teleport Assault – that is referenced on many units’ datasheets, and is described below.

# TELEPORT ASSAULT

The soul of the Grey Knights is sacrosanct, and their purity is incorruptible. The silvered armour of this Chapter’s warriors is bound with incantations, engraved with sigils of warding. Their blades shine with the inner light of their sanctity, for each of these Space Marines is a psychic warrior, in empyric communion with his battle-brothers. Empowered by minds constantly on guard, they can cut steel with bare hands, their eyes blaze with fire and even the power of their words flays the otherworldly skin of daemons. They are the Imperium’s foremost sword and shield against the daemonic. Guided by the foresight and prophecies of the Chapter’s Prognosticars, a Grey Knight can adapt to the most irrational of foes and, in a flare of teleportation energies, emerge at exactly the right location to unleash their devastating power.

Your Librarian model is your Warlord and has the Banishment Stone Enhancement. You can replace this with Dominating Aura.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# BANISHMENT STONE (PSYCHIC)

This rare psychoreactive crystal sits within a theldrite housing wired into the base of the bearer’s skull. When the bearer strikes down an enemy war leader, in the moment of their death the foe’s despairing psyche is amplified through the crystal into a shock wave of dismay that paralyses the minds and souls of their followers. The Grey Knights are more than capable of capitalising upon such disarray amongst their foes.

Each time the bearer destroys an enemy Character model, roll one D6: on a 2+, you gain 1CP.

# Special Ability

At the end of your opponent’s turn, you can select one Grey Knights unit from your army with this ability (excluding units that are within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units). Remove that unit from the battlefield.

In the Reinforcements step of your next Movement phase, set that unit up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models. Any units that are not on the battlefield at the end of the battle count as destroyed.

# OR

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# DOMINATING AURA (PSYCHIC)

The sheer psychic presence of this warrior is like a brooding thunderhead that blazes with silver lightning and scourges the cringing minds of his foes. Even the staunchest enemies give back before his advance, surrendering hard won ground in their terror.

The bearer has an Objective Control characteristic of 3.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# CHAMPION OF TITAN

Striding out across the stars from the Grey Knights’ hidden fortress monastery, this warrior seeks out the most terrible and monstrous of heretic champions and strikes them down in the Emperor’s name.

You score 6VP each time your Warlord destroys an enemy Character model.

# STRATAGEMS

# WARDED PLATE

Ancient and powerful warding sigils render the masterwork armour of the Grey Knights unbelievably resilient.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

COST: 1CP

TARGET: One Grey Knights Infantry unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, if the Strength characteristic of that attack is greater than your unit’s Toughness characteristic, subtract 1 from the Wound roll.

# UNYIELDING TO THE LAST

AURELLIOS’ BANISHERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# NO ESCAPE

Not lightly are the Grey Knights sent into battle. When they strike, they do so against foes whose very existence risks the sanity of Humanity and the fabric of reality. Whether the enemy are themselves the manifestation of heresy or will, by their unwitting actions, unleash it, the remedy remains the same. They must be outmanoeuvred, their every avenue of escape cut off, and then slain.

At the end of any of your opponent’s turns, you score 10VP if you control the objective marker closest to your opponent’s battlefield edge and you control the objective marker closest to your own battlefield edge.

# EMERGENCY TELEPORT

So highly trained are the Grey Knights and so heavily warded their teleportation technology that they will risk close-proximity localised teleportation should the situation demand it.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Fight phase.

COST: 2CP

TARGET: One Grey Knights Infantry unit from your army that is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.

EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit is eligible to be selected for the Teleport Assault ability, even though it is within Engagement Range of enemy units.

You can only score VP from this objective once per battle.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

Librarian Aurellios has turned the endless hunger of the inimical warp into a weapon he can wield against his foes, for he is able to unleash its empyric currents on his enemies and send them tumbling away into the infernal void. A peerless warrior and masterful strategist, Aurellios truly is the bane of any who face him.

Strike Squads often form a vanguard, striking swiftly and slipping through gaps in daemonic lines to seal warp portals or prevent summoners escaping. Frequently attacking from fixed teleportariums or rapid transports, they conduct vital reconnaissance, disrupt flanks and blunt incursions with surgical strikes.

Brotherhood Terminators form the steel heart of many Grey Knights strikes. Shielded by thick armour plates, each is a warrior of immense physical and mental fortitude. They often teleport directly into battle, unleashing sanctified bolts before cleaving apart the spawn of the warp with blazing Nemesis force weapons.
