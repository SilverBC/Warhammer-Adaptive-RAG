# COMBAT PATROL: GENESTEALER CULTS

# HAND OF THE MAGUS

Pouring up from the Nykol Consortium under-mines of Lasmar III, this twisted horde of Genestealer Cultists seek to throw off the chains of their Imperial oppressors. They are led by the cunning Magus Veridielle, who has forged a ragtag collection of mutants, monsters and stolen mining equipment into a powerful army of rebellion.

# COMBAT PATROL: GENESTEALER CULTS

# HAND OF THE MAGUS

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Hand of the Magus can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Cult Ambush – that is referenced on some units’ datasheets, and is described below.

# CULT AMBUSH

Genestealer Cults keep their fighting strength carefully hidden from their oppressors until the glorious Day of Ascension arrives. Even as battle rages, reinforcements slip from the shadows or spill up from the dark places below, called to war by the Broodmind.

Each time a unit with this ability is destroyed, roll one D6, adding 3 to the result if it is a Battleline unit. On a 4+, that unit is placed into Cult Ambush and you can place one Cult Ambush marker* anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy units (if this is not possible, no marker is placed).

Your Magus model is your Warlord and has the Psionic Shield Enhancement. You can replace this with Resonance Stave.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# PSIONIC SHIELD

The Magus fashions a shield of psionic energy and lets it billow outward to ward away the firepower of the foe.

While the bearer is leading a unit, each time a ranged attack is allocated to a model in that unit, add 1 to the saving throw made against that attack.

If an enemy model (excluding Aircraft models) ends any kind of move within 9" of a Cult Ambush marker you placed, that Cult Ambush marker is removed from the battlefield. At the end of the Reinforcements step of your opponent’s next Movement phase, for each of your Cult Ambush markers that is still on the battlefield, you can select one unit from your army that is in Cult Ambush and set that destroyed unit back up on the battlefield using the Deep Strike ability, containing all of its models with their full wounds remaining and with at least one of those models touching that Cult Ambush marker (that Cult Ambush marker is then removed from the battlefield).

Characters that are attached to a unit with this ability are not returned alongside that unit should it return to the battlefield as described above (only the Bodyguard unit returns).

Designer’s Note: Each time a unit with this ability is destroyed, it triggers all rules that apply when a unit is destroyed. For example, if a rule awards a player 1VP each time an enemy unit is destroyed, and a unit with this ability is destroyed, returned using this ability then subsequently destroyed again, it would award the opponent 2VP.

* A circular marker 32mm in diameter should be used for Cult Ambush markers.

# OR

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# RESONANCE STAVE

Fashioned with a core of psychoreactive chitin, this weapon thrums with the gestalt energies of the Broodmind. It need only land the lightest blow upon a foe to blast away their sanity and contort their body with bone-shattering spasms of agony.

Melee weapons equipped by the bearer have the [ANTI-INFANTRY 5+] and [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] abilities.

# Combat Patrol

When playing a Combat Patrol battle, in battle rounds four and five, you cannot set up any units that are in Cult Ambush on the battlefield.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

You will use the Rise Up secondary objective. You can replace this with Will of the Patriarch.

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# RISE UP

By seizing key locations and employing them to spread the cult’s incendiary propaganda, the fires of rebellion can be fed until they grow into full-blown revolution. From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your opponent’s turn, roll one D6 for each objective marker you control that has one or more Neophyte Hybrid units from your army within range of it (excluding Battle-shocked units): on a 1-3, you score 1VP; on a 4+, you score 3VP.

# STRATAGEMS

You can use the following Stratagems:

# DEFEND THE MAGUS

# HAND OF THE MAGUS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

The faithful will expend every effort to protect their Magus, for she is touched by the will of the Patriarch and is surely his living prophet.

WHEN: Start of your Shooting phase or start of the Fight phase.

COST: 1CP

TARGET: One Magus unit from your army and one enemy unit within Engagement Range of that Magus unit.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a Genestealer Cults model from your army makes an attack that targets that enemy unit, re-roll a Hit roll of 1 and re-roll a Wound roll of 1.

# LURKING KILLERS

# HAND OF THE MAGUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Combining guerrilla tactics and local knowledge with rudiments of alien instincts not their own, Genestealer Cultists display an almost supernatural ability to blend into cover.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

COST: 1CP

TARGET: One Genestealer Cults Infantry unit from your army (excluding Aberrant units) that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.

# RETURN TO THE SHADOWS

# HAND OF THE MAGUS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Seeing the foe advancing heedlessly into their trap, the cultists fade into the gloom and move to encircle or outflank their prey.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Movement phase, just after an enemy unit ends a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move.

COST: 1CP

TARGET: One Genestealer Cults Infantry unit from your army that is within 9" of that enemy unit.

EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal move of up to D6". If your unit has the Magus keyword, it can make a Normal move of up to 6" instead.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# WILL OF THE PATRIARCH

Every member of the Genestealer Cult lives to obey their alien Patriarch and will go to any lengths to further its goals. Whether it be seizing a location the xenos monster deems vital, securing some holy icon or vital plans it desires, or whatever other expression of its will, the Magus will see it done.

At the end of the battle, you score 15VP if your Magus model is within 3" of the centre of the battlefield.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

Magus Veridielle is a powerful psyker, her formidable will enhanced by the gestalt powers of the Star Children – the ominous xenos gods the Genestealer Cults worship. She is able to manipulate the psionic energies of the Broodmind to shield her followers from harm, or else to strike down her foes with surges of xeno-tainted energies.

Making up the bulk of their cult’s ranks, Neophyte Hybrids are the least alien in appearance of all the Patriarch’s brood. They are no less dangerous for this, however, and what they lack in weaponised bio-adaptations they make up for in numbers, massed firepower and zealous revolutionary fanaticism.

|Movement|Strength|Save|Wounds|Leadership|Objective Control|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|6"|4|5+|1|7+|2|

Acolyte Hybrids are the offspring of the first hosts infected by the Genestealer Curse, and they are accordingly monstrous in body and mind. Possessed of hulking strength and the skill to manipulate complex mechanisms, they bear repurposed industrial tools and deadly close-quarters firearms into battle.

No one truly knows what causes Aberrants to spring up amidst the brood cycle, yet the uses of these lumpen gene-deviants are obvious. Possessed of immense strength and resilience coupled with simplistic loyalty to the cult, they are hurled into battle as line breakers or massed as hulking, expendable bodyguards.

The drilldozer blade fitted to the Goliath Rockgrinder is intended for gouging tunnels deep into solid rock faces in search of mineral riches. However, it works just as well as both an ablative shield and a hideously bloody line-breaking weapon, mangling a crimson path through the luckless foe.
