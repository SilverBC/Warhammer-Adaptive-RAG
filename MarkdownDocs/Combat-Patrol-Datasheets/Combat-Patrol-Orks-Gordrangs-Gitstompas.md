# Combat Patrol: Orks

# COMBAT PATROL: ORKS

# GORDRANG’S GITSTOMPAS

Nothing gets in the way of Warboss Gordrang’s ladz. At least, not without being riddled with bullets and rokkits, smashed flat with an assortment of piston-driven klaws, then trampled into the mud by a stampede of bellowing lunatics. What Gordrang lacks in subtlety – and it’s a lot – is more than made up for by the brute savagery and resilience of his horde, who live to rampage across battlefield after battlefield and hurl themselves into every fight they can find.

# Combat Patrol: Orks

# Gordrang’s Gitstompas

# Abilities

The datasheets required to use Gordrang’s Gitstompas can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Waaagh! – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

# WAAAGH!

The infamous war cry of the Orks is known and feared throughout the galaxy. When it echoes across the battlefield, bellowed from hundreds or even thousands of greenskin mouths, even the most stalwart warriors fear the onslaught to come.

Once per battle, at the start of the battle round, you can call a Waaagh!. If you do, until the start of the next battle round:

- Orks units from your army are eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which they Advanced.

Your Warboss model is your Warlord and has the Grizzled Skarboy Enhancement. You can replace this with Tellyporta.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# GRIZZLED SKARBOY

The more fights an Ork survives, the bigger, meaner, and more covered in leathery scars he becomes. Many Warbosses boast a gnarled green hide as tough as any conventional body armour and are capable of shrugging off the sort of firepower that would cripple a light tank.

- Each time a ranged attack is allocated to the bearer, halve the Damage characteristic of that attack.
- Add 1 to the Strength and Attacks characteristics of melee weapons equipped by Orks models from your army.
- Orks models from your army have a 5+ invulnerable save.

# OR

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# TELLYPORTA

What Ork teleportation technology lacks in safety measures, accuracy, reliability, blueprints or indeed the most basic comprehension of its functions by those who use it, it more than makes up for in its ability to catapult mobs of bellowing Orks through the warp and directly into the teeth of their horrified foes.

In the Declare Battle Formations step, select one Boyz unit from your army. Until the end of the battle, the bearer and every model in that Boyz unit have the Deep Strike ability. When setting these units up on the battlefield using the Deep Strike ability, they must be set up in the same turn and within 3" of each other.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# STOMP ’EM

Ork battle strategy rarely stretches far beyond singling out their victims, piling onto them with choppas swinging, and engaging in an orgy of gratuitous violence that doesn’t peter out until the last of the foe stops twitching. Fortunately for these brutish xenos, it is an approach at which they naturally excel.

From the second battle round onwards, at the start of the battle round, select one enemy unit that is not destroyed to be your army’s target. At the end of the battle round, you score 3VP if your army’s target for that battle round was destroyed by a melee attack made by an Orks model from your army.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# PROPER LOOTIN’

Be it priceless technological artefacts, heaps of guns and ammo, a nifty statue ideal for target practice, or just a pile of especially shiny rocks, Orks will happily rip it to bits for salvage and – more often than not – find a way to seriously injure people with it.

While Orks delight in the deafening din and ferocious recoil of a good firefight, they take a dim view of the foe shooting them before they can get stuck into a proper hand-to-hand brawl. Such unsporting behaviour is likely to provoke a swift and violent response.

At the end of your Command phase, for each objective marker you control that is not within your deployment zone and has not yet been looted by your army, you can attempt to loot it. You can loot an objective marker if one or more Orks units from your army are within range of that objective marker and those units are not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units. If this is the case, roll one D6: on a 2-4, your army has looted that objective marker and you score 3VP; on a 5+, your army has looted that objective marker and you score 5VP.

# STRATAGEMS

# GET STUCK IN

# GORDRANG’S GITSTOMPAS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Orks hurl themselves into close-quarters combat with unalloyed eagerness bordering on delight.

- COST: 1CP
- WHEN: Fight phase.
- TARGET: One Orks unit from your army that has not been selected to fight this phase.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes a Pile-in or Consolidation move, it can move up to 6" instead of up to 3".

# BRUTAL BUT KUNNIN’

# GORDRANG’S GITSTOMPAS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Subtle, Orks are not, but their seemingly random outbursts of violence and healthy dose of feral cunning make them unpredictable – and thus even more dangerous – foes.

- COST: 1CP
- WHEN: Your Charge phase.
- TARGET: One Orks Infantry unit from your army.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your unit is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which it Fell Back.

Any good Ork hunter knows the safest way to deal with a rampaging Warboss is to hit them with tank-busting artillery from as far away as possible. By donning a piston-driven suit of incredibly durable mega armour, Gordrang makes a mockery of such underhanded tactics, much to the terror of his foes.

Ork Boyz surge into battle in huge, unruly mobs dotted with crude special weapons and led by foul-tempered Boss Nobz. Most simply stampede towards the enemy lines, relying on their numbers and natural hardiness to carry the charge home, while others hitch a ride on Trukks and Battlewagons so as to get stuck in all the faster.

Most Orks take a dim view of muckin’ about in the sky, and would much rather go to war with their feet firmly on the ground. Deffkopta pilots are the lunatic exception, hurtling ahead to spy out enemy forces for their warband to bring to battle, and to give those same enemies a good strafing run or three in the meantime.

Being wired into a Deff Dread affords strength, resilience and a terrifying array of vicious weaponry. Of course, the reality of being stuck in a metal box for life and drinking your meals through a straw soon gets old, but the pilots’ resulting unhinged ferocity only serves to make Deff Dreads all the more dangerous in battle.
