# Unit Overview

The Atalan Jackals are primarily a harassing unit that can be utilised to pick apart already damaged enemies, but be careful not to throw them away wastefully, as in Combat Patrol they lack the Cult Ambush rule. Instead, it is often best to marshal them carefully, exploiting their swiftness to make daring dashes for objective markers (particularly helpful if you select the Safeguard the Sanctuary secondary objective).

# Strategic Considerations

Both Enhancements available to your Jackal Alphus enable you to offset some of your force’s limitations. Priority Kill Order can be used to counteract the weaker Ballistic Skill of the Achilles Ridgerunner’s otherwise very potent weaponry, making for a stronger early strike, while Master of Suppression can be used to boost the durability of your wider force.

Whichever you go with, the Jackal Alphus is best used to support and empower the other elements of your army, rather than primarily as a damage dealer – unless, that is, your opponent exposes a fragile character to the deadly [PRECISION] shots of this model’s cult sniper rifle!

Should your Hybrid Metamorphs find themselves threatened by enemy melee units, the Metamorphic Spasm Stratagem can be put to great effect, especially against well-armoured targets less susceptible to hand flamer fire. Used at the right moment, this Stratagem will be well worth the CP investment, maximising the combat punch of your models even as they are slain.

They are also an excellent target for the Point-blank Ambush Stratagem, being able to move into close proximity with key targets then inflict extra damage as a result of the [LETHAL HITS] ability.# Warhammer 40K - Achilles Ridgerunner and Hybrid Metamorphs

# Combat Strategy

Most of your force’s ability to deal with larger, more heavily armoured threats comes in the form of the Hybrid Metamorphs’ melee weapons, but getting these attacks to where they need to be is easier said than done. This is where the Achilles missile launcher comes in. This weapon is ideally suited to dealing early damage to enemy vehicles or monsters, before you find yourself having to commit your infantry to the fight. In addition, should your opponent be fielding more of an armoured infantry force, this model’s Crossfire ability can really help the attacks of friendly models cut through their targets, be that to support ranged firepower or to set up a lethal melee ambush.

The Hybrid Metamorphs comprise the main backbone of this Combat Patrol, featuring a high number of Torrent weapons that naturally lend themselves to the Fire Overwatch Stratagem. These are backed up with very adaptable melee weapons, which can be turned upon most infantry threats and even some bigger foes. Though the Hybrid Metamorphs have some durability through both the Feel No Pain ability and the Cult Ambush rule, neither of these can be completely relied upon, so it is crucial to use their Scout move to gain an early positioning advantage, making good use of terrain to keep them out of sight of enemy ranged units.# Combat Patrol - Claw of Ascension

# COMBAT PATROL

# CLAW OF ASCENSION

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use the Claw of Ascension can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. In some cases this will include a Faction ability – Cult Ambush – which is described below.

# CULT AMBUSH

Genestealer Cults keep their fighting strength carefully hidden from their oppressors until the glorious Day of Ascension arrives. Even as most rise up amidst raging battle, reinforcements slip from the shadows or spill up from the dark places below, called to war by the Broodmind.

Each time a unit with this ability is destroyed, roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if it is the first or second battle round. On a 5+, add a new unit to your army identical to your destroyed unit, in Cult Ambush, at its Starting Strength, with all of its wounds remaining and any [ONE SHOT] weapons those models are equipped with considered as not having been shot. While a unit is in Cult Ambush, it is also considered to be in Reserves. Then place one Cult Ambush marker* anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy units (if this is not possible, no marker is placed).

Your Jackal Alphus model is your Warlord and has the Priority Kill Order Enhancement. You can replace this with Master of Suppression.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# PRIORITY KILL ORDER

With a combination of encrypted vox-hails, skilful strategic prioritising and the authoritative pulse of the Broodmind, this outrider commander transmits firing coordinates and enemy movement vectors. Their chosen target is doomed as the cult brings their hatred to bear from every direction.

At the start of your Shooting phase, select one enemy unit visible to the bearer. Until the end of the phase, each time a friendly Genestealer Cults model makes an attack that targets that enemy unit, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

If an enemy model (excluding Aircraft) ends any kind of move within 9" of a Cult Ambush marker you placed, that Cult Ambush marker is removed from the battlefield. At the end of the Reinforcements step of your opponent’s next Movement phase, for each of your Cult Ambush markers still on the battlefield, you can select one unit from your army that is in Cult Ambush and set up that unit using that Cult Ambush marker. To do so, set that unit up on the battlefield more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy units, with at least one model in that unit touching that Cult Ambush marker and all other models placed wholly within 3" of that Cult Ambush marker (that Cult Ambush marker is then removed from the battlefield).

Characters that are attached to a unit with this ability are not returned alongside that unit should it return to the battlefield as described above (only the Bodyguard unit returns).

Designer’s Note: Each time a unit with this ability is destroyed, it triggers all rules that apply when a unit is destroyed. For example, if a rule awards a player 1VP each time an enemy unit is destroyed, and a unit with this ability is destroyed, returned using this ability then subsequently destroyed again, it would award the opponent 2VP.

# OR

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# MASTER OF SUPPRESSION

Every member of a Genestealer Cult has their role in the uprising and their worthy contribution to the eventual arrival of the Star Children. Selflessly safeguarding one's broodkin is as vital as slaying the oppressors, for those that survive have their missions of murder, sabotage and rebellion to enact.

In your Shooting phase, after the bearer’s unit has shot, select one enemy unit hit by one or more of those attacks. Until the start of your next Shooting phase, each time a model in that enemy unit makes an attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.

* A circular 32mm diameter marker should be used for Cult Ambush markers.

# COMBAT PATROL | CLAW OF ASCENSION# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# STRATAGEMS

You will use the Infiltration Agenda secondary objective. You can use the following Stratagems:

You can replace this with Safeguard the Sanctuary.

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# INFILTRATION AGENDA

The Patriarch's telepathic urging has implanted the true goal in its broodkin: breaching enemy lines. From there, the cult can wreak havoc with sabotage, taint the oppressors' supply lines or amass a cache of vital military intelligence.

At the end of your turn, you score 4VP if one or more Genestealer Cults units from your army (excluding Battle-shocked units) are within your opponent’s deployment zone.

# METAMORPHIC SPASM

Should they be struck down, those cultists most blessed by the Star Children in their biological extremities thrash with paroxysms of vengeance. With a final lash of tendrils and talons, they pull down their killers with instinctive fury.

|Cost|1CP|
|---|---|
|WHEN|Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.|
|TARGET|One Hybrid Metamorphs unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.|
|EFFECT|Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6. On a 4+, do not remove the destroyed model from play; it can fight after the attacking unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.|

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

Scrambling in close with pistols blazing and talons slashing or roaring past in a blitzing drive-by, the broodkin target their enemies' weak points in a deluge of attacks.

|Cost|1CP|
|---|---|
|WHEN|Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase.|
|TARGET|One Genestealer Cults unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase.|
|EFFECT|Until the end of the phase, weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability while targeting enemy units within 12".|

# SAFEGUARD THE SANCTUARY

The faithless are not worthy to learn the shadowy secrets of the cult. Whether a hidden tunnel network to outmanoeuvre the foe, a senior cult leader to safeguard or perhaps a cache of stolen munitions for future missions, we must defend these secrets and keep them from discovery at all costs.

At the end of the battle, you score 10VP if you control the objective marker closest to your battlefield edge.

# SWARM THE OPPRESSORS

When they have the foe in their sights, the cult's zealous insurrectionists rush them in a chillingly coordinated assault.

|Cost|1CP|
|---|---|
|WHEN|Start of your Charge phase.|
|TARGET|One or more Genestealer Cults units from your army.|
|EFFECT|Select one enemy unit. Until the end of the phase, each time one of your units declares a charge, if that enemy unit is a target of that charge, add 1 to the Charge roll.|
