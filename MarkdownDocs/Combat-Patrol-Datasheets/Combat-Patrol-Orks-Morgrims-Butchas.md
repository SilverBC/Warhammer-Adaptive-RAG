# MORGRIM’S BUTCHAS

# BEASTBOSS MORGRIM (1 MODEL)

- This model is equipped with: shoota; beastchoppa; Beast Snagga klaw.

# BEAST SNAGGA BOYZ (10 MODELS)

- The Beast Snagga Nob is equipped with: slugga; power snappa.
- 1 Beast Snagga Boy is equipped with: thump gun; close combat weapon.
- 8 Beast Snagga Boyz are equipped with: slugga; choppa.

The Beastboss is an incredibly capable model in the Fight phase, his two different melee weapons ensuring that he always has the right tool for the job. The Bestial Bellow Stratagem is also important to keep in mind as, when used at the right time, it can completely flip control of a critical objective, potentially making the difference between victory and defeat. If you find yourself using the Bag the Big ’Un secondary objective against an opponent without any vehicles or monsters, the Bosskilla Enhancement is also worth considering as an excellent way to pick the enemy Warlord out from their Bodyguard unit.

Beast Snagga Boyz are particularly vicious in combat, sporting a particularly high Strength characteristic for a Battleline unit, and even able to deal a degree of damage to vehicles and monsters thanks to their Monster Hunters ability. You should not expect them to take down these large threats by themselves though, so carefully combining their attacks with those of the Squighog Boyz and Beastboss is crucial to reaching a critical mass of damage output.# Warhammer 40K - Beast Snagga Boyz and Squighog Boyz

- The Beast Snagga Nob is equipped with:

- power snappa
- 1 Beast Snagga Boy is equipped with:

- close combat weapon
- 8 Beast Snagga Boyz are equipped with:

While the Tough As Squig‑hide Stratagem lets your infantry units double down on their durability and hold fast against the strongest of enemy weapons, they are still vulnerable to large amounts of small arms fire, so don’t forget to exploit the battlefield’s terrain features to keep your units hidden or protected by the Benefit of Cover against such attacks.

# Squighog Boyz (4 Models)

- The Nob on Smasha Squig is equipped with:
- slugga
- big choppa
- squig jaws
- 3 Squighog Boyz are equipped with:
- saddlegit weapons
- stikka
- squig jaws

The Squighog Boyz are the hardest hitting of all the models available to you in this Combat Patrol, and they are particularly effective on the charge. Watch out for enemy elite infantry that are capable in melee, however, as such threats can pose a real danger. You will want to avoid your Squighog Boyz getting tied down in a battle of attrition against such units, so do not be afraid to bide your time, going in for that killing charge only when you think the Squighog Boyz will have maximum impact.# Combat Patrol - Morgrim’s Butchas

# COMBAT PATROL

# MORGRIM’S BUTCHAS

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Morgrim’s Butchas can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Waaagh! – which is described below.

# WAAAGH!

The infamous war cry of the Orks is known and feared throughout the galaxy. When it echoes across the battlefield, bellowed from hundreds or even thousands of toothy maws, even the most stalwart warriors fear the onslaught to come.

If your Army Faction is Orks, once per battle, at the start of the battle round, you can call a Waaagh!. If you do, until the start of the next battle round, the Waaagh! is active for your army and:

- Units from your army with this ability are eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which they Advanced.
- Add 1 to the Strength and Attacks characteristics of melee weapons equipped by models from your army with this ability.
- Models from your army with this ability have a 5+ invulnerable save.

Your Beastboss model is your Warlord and has the Half‑chewed Enhancement. You can replace this with Bosskilla.

# ENHANCEMENTS

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# HALF‑CHEWED

This boss’ many bionik replacements attest to a lifetime of confronting the most dangerous beasts he can find, and coming out victorious. Those who follow him are eager to prove they are tough enough to join his biggest hunts and arrogantly ignore dire wounds that would keep them from their prey.

Models in the bearer’s unit have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability. In addition, each time a ranged attack is allocated to a model in the bearer’s unit, add 1 to any armour saving throw made against that attack.

# OR

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# BOSSKILLA

Ork bosses must constantly prove themselves the biggest and baddest fighters, and this Beastboss has a well‑earned reputation for seeking out and pulverising the foe’s most dangerous champions in gory displays of superiority.

Melee weapons equipped by the bearer have the [PRECISION] and [SUSTAINED HITS 1] abilities.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# BAG THE BIG ’UN

Beast Snagga Orks are instinctively drawn to the biggest threats on the battlefield, seeing their destruction as an irresistible challenge. Not to mention, of course, the bragging rights among the warband and the impressive trophies that can be harvested from their ruined carcass if they succeed.

At the start of the first battle round, select one enemy Monster or Vehicle model. If there are no such enemy models, select the enemy Warlord model instead.

At the end of the battle, you score 8VP if that enemy model is destroyed. If that enemy model was destroyed by your Beastboss model, you score 12VP instead.

# KRUMPIN’ SPREE

Whether aiming to loot the foe’s stash of fancy gear, to show the gitz who’s boss by getting right up in their face or just letting off steam after a successful hunt, Orks relish the simple strategy of piling right into – and often straight through – the enemy army’s heart.

At the end of your turn, you score 3VP if you control the objective marker closest to your opponent’s battlefield edge and you score 1VP for each other objective you control that is not within your deployment zone.

# STRATAGEMS

# TOUGH AS SQUIG‑HIDE

Orks – and especially Beast Snaggas – live tough lives, their hardy constitutions pushed to extremes. They frequently try to outdo each other in feats of resilience in the face of enemy attacks, eager to mete out a kicking to the foe.

|Cost|When|Target|Effect|
|---|---|---|---|
|1CP|Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.|One Orks Infantry unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.|Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, if the Strength characteristic of that attack is greater than the Toughness characteristic of your unit, subtract 1 from the Wound roll.|

# BESTIAL BELLOW

In the face of a deafening roar erupting from an enormous gob filled with huge fangs, even the most stoic of warriors can be shaken to their core.

|Cost|When|Target|Effect|
|---|---|---|---|
|1CP|Start of the Fight phase.|One Beastboss or Squighog Boyz model from your army.|Select one enemy unit within 3" of your model. That enemy unit must take a Battle‑shock test and when doing so, subtract 1 from the result.|

# MORGRIM’S BUTCHAS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

No Ork willingly holds back from a good fight like a weedy grot. With a threat‑laden war cry, the most belligerent will encourage the rest of the ladz into a race to reach the enemy.

|Cost|When|Target|Effect|
|---|---|---|---|
|1CP|Fight phase, just before an Orks unit from your army Piles In.|That Orks unit.|Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes a Pile‑in move, it can move up to 6" instead of up to 3".|# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

It takes a ferocious and foul‑tempered Ork to lead a stampede of Beast Snaggas. Beastboss Morgrim possesses these qualities in abundance. Boasting cybork enhancements, a wired‑in targetin’ squig and an array of brutal combat weaponry, this roaring monster can bring down even the largest prey one‑on‑one.

Big, brutal, and belligerent, Beast Snagga Boyz are a force to be reckoned with. From the fist‑shells of their thump guns, to the inescapable hooks of their choppas, Beast Snaggas excel in softening up their prey, dragging them down, then ripping them bodily to bits.

With their mounts snorting and saddlegitz hanging on for dear life, Squighog Boyz thunder into the fight, flinging rokkit‑propelled stikkas with enough force to pierce plate armour. Led into the fray by Nobz atop thick‑skulled smasha squigs, they employ muscle, weight, momentum and sheer belligerence to squash those foes still standing to a paste.
