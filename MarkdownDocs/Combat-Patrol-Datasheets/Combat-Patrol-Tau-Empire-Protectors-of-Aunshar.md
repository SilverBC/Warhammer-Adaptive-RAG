# Combat Patrol: T'AU Empire

# Protectors of Aun’Shar

It is the belief of the Ethereal Aun’Shar that he can best spread the light of the Greater Good by taking to the battlefields of the 41st Millennium and overseeing the destruction of those foes who simply cannot be enlightened through diplomatic negotiation. The Fire caste warriors who fight at his side venerate their leader and follow his commands without the slightest hesitation. They live to see his will done, and would die without regret to ensure his continued survival.

This Combat Patrol includes the units shown below.

# COMBAT PATROL: T’AU EMPIRE

# PROTECTORS OF AUN’SHAR

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use the Protectors of Aun’Shar can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – For the Greater Good – that is referenced on many units’ datasheets, and is described below.

Your Ethereal model is your Warlord and has the DS13 Experimental Drone Enhancement. You can replace this with DS15 Experimental Drone.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# FOR THE GREATER GOOD

The Hunter Cadres battle for the betterment of the T’au Empire, not for personal gain or egotistic accomplishments. This burning commitment allows for prodigiously effective covering fire. Enemies are pinned in place by deadly bursts of pulse blasts, or the infamous T’au markerlight is used to expose even well-fortified enemy positions, allowing other T’au warriors to fall on the vulnerable enemies with murderous force.

# DS13 EXPERIMENTAL DRONE (AURA)

This hover drone has been specially commissioned for use by Ethereals who prefer to lead from the front. Designed by renowned Earth caste engineers, it incorporates a cutting-edge force field emitter that not only obfuscates the whereabouts of drone and rider, but also projects a defensive energy shield around those warriors who stand in the Ethereal’s defence.

In your Shooting phase, units from your army can work in pairs to help each other target specific enemy units. When they do this, one unit is the Observer unit and the other is their Guided unit. The enemy they are targeting is called their Spotted unit.

Each time you select this unit to shoot, if it is not an Observer unit, it can use this ability. If it does, select one other friendly unit with this ability (note that Aun’Shar does not have this ability) that is also eligible to shoot (excluding Battle-shocked and Observer units). Until the end of the phase, this unit is considered a Guided unit, and that friendly unit is considered an Observer unit. Then select one enemy unit that is visible to both your units to be their Spotted unit. Until the end of the phase:

- Each time a model in a Guided unit makes an attack that targets their Spotted unit, improve the Ballistic Skill characteristic of the attack by 1 and, if their Observer unit has the Markerlight keyword, the attack has the [IGNORES COVER] ability.
- Each time a model in a Guided unit makes an attack that does not target their Spotted unit, worsen the Ballistic Skill characteristic of the attack by 1.

The bearer has the Lone Operative and Stealth abilities. While a friendly T’au Empire Infantry unit is within 6" of the bearer, improve the Save characteristic of models in that unit by 1 and those models have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability.

# OR

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# DS15 EXPERIMENTAL DRONE (AURA)

An adaptation on the DS13 design, the DS15 sacrifices a certain amount of protective capability in favour of mounting a pulse-capacitance supercharger module. This potent device increases the ferocity of nearby T’au ranged weaponry, rendering already potent firearms truly terrifying.

The bearer has the Lone Operative and Stealth abilities. While a friendly T’au Empire unit is within 6" of the bearer, ranged weapons equipped by models in that unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.# Warhammer 40K - Kauyon Lure and Stratagems


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# KAUYON LURE

The martial philosophy of Kauyon is that of the patient hunter. By positioning T’au forces to incentivise the foe advancing aggressively upon them, its proponents lure their quarry into the kill box ready for the ambush that must surely follow.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your Command phase, you score 5VP if there are one or more T’au Empire units from your army (excluding Battle-shocked units) within your deployment zone.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# LEADERSHIP CASTE

To all other T’au, the Ethereals are sacred beings whose safety is of paramount importance. No T’au would think twice about giving their life if it ensured the survival of an Ethereal, and it is the most grievous tragedy to permit such a singular being to fall.

At the end of the battle, you score 20VP if your Ethereal model is not destroyed.

# STRATAGEMS

# DEFENSIVE FUSILLADE

Warriors of the Fire caste train to keep selecting targets and gunning them down even as the foe close to point-blank range.

- Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
- TARGET: One T’au Empire unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [PISTOL] ability.

# RAPID REPOSITIONING

T’au military doctrine is highly mobile, placing little value on retaining territory compared to the preservation of T’au lives and the elimination of the enemy’s strength.

- Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: End of your Shooting phase.
- TARGET: One T’au Empire unit from your army that is not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.
- EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal move up to D6". If your unit has the Battlesuit keyword, it can make a Normal move of up to 6" instead.
- RESTRICTIONS: Until the end of the turn, your unit is not eligible to declare a charge.

# LASER-MARKED TARGETS

Painted with markerlights by well-hidden Pathfinders, the foe are perfectly triangulated ready to be cut down as they charge.

- Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase, just after an enemy unit has declared a charge.
- TARGET: One T’au Empire unit from your army that was selected as a target of that charge and is not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.
- EFFECT: Your unit can shoot that enemy unit as if it were your Shooting phase. When doing so, each time a model in your unit makes a ranged attack, an unmodified Hit roll of 6 is required to score a hit, irrespective of the attacking weapon’s Ballistic Skill or any modifiers. Until the end of the phase, subtract 2 from Charge rolls made for that enemy unit.
- RESTRICTIONS: Your unit cannot shoot more than once this turn.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

Like all Ethereals, Aun’Shar is serene and wise, a spiritual leader of the T’au who embodies the unity of the Greater Good. In times of war he is ever keen to take to the field in person, fighting with his energised honour stave, skimming above the battle aboard his hover drone and invoking the fundamental might of the T’au castes.

Specialists in infantry-based battlefield tactics, Cadre Fireblades eschew the honour of a battlesuit in order to fight selflessly amongst the Fire caste’s rank and file. Their veteran wisdom is of great benefit to the warriors alongside whom they fight, optimising the ferocity and accuracy of their firepower.

Fire Warrior Strike Teams are the mainstay of many Hunter Cadres, unleashing storms of potent anti-personnel firepower that few foes can long endure. Tough, dependable, numerous and with access to a variety of specialised weaponry and drone support, these Fire Warriors will hold the line no matter what odds they face.

Nothing so huge should be able to slip unnoticed across the battlefield, yet between its stealth field and its electrowarfare suite the Ghostkeel Battlesuit does just that. Once in position its pilot unleashes ferocious volleys of firepower, ambushing, overwhelming and scattering the terrified foe in a matter of moments.
