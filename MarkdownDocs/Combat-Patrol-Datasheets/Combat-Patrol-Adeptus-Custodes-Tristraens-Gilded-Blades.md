# Tristraen’s Gilded Blades


This Combat Patrol includes the units shown below. Before the battle, in the Select Combat Patrol and Enhancement step, you must select either the Custodian Wardens unit or the Allarus Custodians unit to include in your Combat Patrol for the battle.

# Custodian Wardens

# (3 Models)

- 1 model is equipped with: castellan axe.
- 2 models are equipped with: guardian spear.

# Tristraen

# (1 Model)

- This model is equipped with: vaultswords.

When selecting your army for a battle, you will have to choose between this unit and the Allarus Custodians. What the Wardens bring to the table is a higher model count and a greater ability to control and contest objective markers. This does come at the expense of a reduced ranged damage output, however, so which is best will depend on a combination of your objectives and your opponent’s army.

Where they particularly shine is against a more elite enemy force, perhaps one containing a monster or vehicle, where the high damage output of their castellan axe will prove a very powerful tool. The Blade Champion is a whirlwind of death when it comes to melee combat. Thanks to the vaultswords’ three different profiles he is able to tailor his attacks perfectly to whatever foe he is facing. It is also important to remember that through the Martial Ka’tah ability, all of those potent weapon profiles can be further augmented, making him a deadly adversary for any opponent.

Tristraen does not have a Bodyguard unit, however, so make sure to use terrain to your advantage and watch out for enemy sharpshooters.# Warhammer 40K - Custodian Units

# CUSTODIAN UNITS

# CUSTODIAN GUARD

# (3 MODELS)

- Every model is equipped with:
- sentinel blade
- praesidium shield

# ALLARUS CUSTODIANS

# (2 MODELS)

- Every model is equipped with:
- balistus grenade launcher
- guardian spear

# UNIT OVERVIEW

The Custodian Guard represent a solid, durable unit thanks to their praesidium shields taking them up to a whopping four wounds each. While they might deal less damage than the other units at your disposal, they have the durability they need to hold on to objectives reliably and still go toe to toe with the enemy’s elite units.

What the Allarus Custodians bring to the table is sheer walking durability with a massive Toughness 7, making them some of the most survivable infantry in the game. Thanks to the Blast ability, their balistus grenade launchers are excellent tools against large units of enemy models. You will have one fewer model if chosen, so weigh your options carefully.

They will win most battles of attrition they find themselves in, so you can afford to play more aggressively against most foes.

# STRATEGY

Regardless of which unit you choose, it is essential to properly support the Custodian Guard with them. An Adeptus Custodes army works best when used as a focused blade to dismantle one part of your foe’s force at a time. If you try to fight on too wide a battlefront, you may find yourself quickly overwhelmed.# Combat Patrol - Tristraen’s Gilded Blades

# TRISTRAEN’S GILDED BLADES

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Tristraen’s Gilded Blades can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Martial Ka’tah – which is described below.

# MARTIAL KA’TAH

Specialised disciplines mastered by Custodians over decades if not centuries, each ka’tah equips its practitioner to overmaster any foe in a particular discipline or philosophy. Martial ka’tahs allow the warriors of the Adeptus Custodes to deploy stances, movements, war philosophies and lethal skills that enhance their already terrifying martial prowess and focus it against particular threats.

Each time a unit from your army with this ability is selected to fight, select one of the Ka’tah Stances below. Until that unit has finished making its attacks, the selected Stance is active for it and it gains the relevant ability:

Your Blade Champion model is your Warlord and has the Watchman of Terra Enhancement. You can replace this with Warrior Exemplar.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# WATCHMAN OF TERRA

A sentinel and guardian without equal, this determined warrior is indomitable in defence. No foe escapes their notice, and at the enemy’s onset they only fight all the harder.

While the bearer is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units, it has an Objective Control characteristic of 4.

# Ka’tah Stances

|Stance|Description|Ability|
|---|---|---|
|Dacatarai Stance|Those Custodians skilled in the Dacatarai Ka’tah are able to turn their enemies’ numerical advantage against them. Reserved for when the Custodians must battle seething hordes of foes, this stance sees them reap a terrible tally.|Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.|
|Rendax Stance|Masters of Rendax are superlative monster and war machine hunters. They have studied every aspect of how to do battle with a foe far larger than themselves, how to evade its powerful attacks, exploit its blind spots and lay it low.|Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.|

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# WARRIOR EXEMPLAR

This master of battle draws inspiration from the annihilation of those who would threaten the Golden Throne.

Each time the bearer destroys an enemy unit, roll one D6: on a 3+, you gain 1CP.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

You will use the Raise the Vexillas secondary objective. You can replace this with Victory’s Price.

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# RAISE THE VEXILLAS

The Custodians have a crucial task to complete within this theatre, and it will be easier to achieve once total strategic control has been secured. Crush those who oppose you and plant your gleaming vexillas that they might proclaim the Emperor’s mastery of this place.

From the third battle round onwards, at the end of your turn, you score 3VP if you control the objective marker closest to your opponent’s battlefield edge and you also control the objective marker closest to your battlefield edge.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# VICTORY’S PRICE

Where the enemies of the Emperor are legion, the Ten Thousand are all too few. Employ their martial might to slaughter the foe, but ensure that you do not lose too many of your irreplaceable warriors or your seeming victory may be rendered hollow indeed.

- Each time an enemy unit is destroyed, you score 3VP.
- Each time an Adeptus Custodes model from your army is destroyed, you lose 1VP (to a minimum of 0VP).

# STRATAGEMS

You can use the following Stratagems:

# THE GILDED SPEAR

# TRISTRAEN’S GILDED BLADES – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Lunging with irresistible fury and speed, the Custodians pierce the enemy battle line and drive deep to deliver the killing thrust.

- Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: Fight phase.
- TARGET: One Adeptus Custodes unit from your army that has not been selected to fight this phase.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes a Pile-in move, it can move up to 6" instead of up to 3".

# INESCAPABLE VENGEANCE

The Emperor’s wrath made manifest, the Adeptus Custodes bestride the battlefield, advancing on their foes with deadly and relentless purpose.

- Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: Your Movement phase.
- TARGET: One Adeptus Custodes unit from your army that has not been selected to move this phase.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, add 2 to Advance rolls made for your unit.

# OVERAWING MAGNIFICENCE

So terrifying is the golden martial majesty of the Adeptus Custodes, that even the most frenzied and hate-fuelled foes may falter at the prospect of engaging them in battle.

- Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase, just after an enemy unit declares a charge.
- TARGET: One Adeptus Custodes unit that was selected as a target of that charge.
- EFFECT: That enemy unit must take a Leadership test. If that test is failed, until the end of the phase, subtract 2 from Charge rolls made for that enemy unit.

Blade Champion Arulon Tristraen has locked blades with more than a score of traitor and alien warlords, and emerged victorious every time. Wielding his archeotech vaultswords in combination with a trio of specialised fighting styles, there is no threat nor enemy that Tristraen is unable to cut down in short order.
