# Combat Patrol Strategy

This Combat Patrol focuses on establishing an early advantage, and the Master of Possession is a key component in this strategy, featuring a strong psychic attack that can be boosted further using his Sacrificial Dagger ability. This does come at the cost of inflicting damage on his own unit, however, so it is important to time its usage appropriately.

Later in the game, when his unit has already taken a number of casualties, using this ability will be a tough call, so be sure to take advantage of it in the first few turns to get the most benefit out of it. Possessed are some of the fastest infantry in the game, able to cover large distances at speed. Their attack output is also excellent, but they are not quite as resilient as other elite fighters such as Terminators. As such, it is important to use their speed to dictate each engagement, and to do so before enemy firepower has a chance to whittle them down.

Should your Possessed find themselves outmanoeuvred, all is not lost; the Daemonic Fervour Stratagem can be used to ensure they make the enemy pay for their transgressions.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Units


# LEGIONARIES (10 MODELS)

- The Aspiring Champion is equipped with:
- plasma pistol
- accursed weapon
- 1 Legionary is equipped with:
- bolt pistol
- meltagun
- close combat weapon
- 1 Legionary is equipped with:
- bolt pistol
- heavy bolter
- close combat weapon
- 7 Legionaries are equipped with:
- bolt pistol
- boltgun
- close combat weapon

The Legionaries represent the primary ranged threat in this Combat Patrol. They are equipped with two powerful weapons that are excellent at taking on enemy monsters and vehicles, in the form of the meltagun and plasma pistol.

These guns are your primary means of inflicting some early wounds on such units, before the massed attacks of your Possessed finish the job. Once a monster or vehicle has suffered enough wounds, it will also be below its Starting Strength, meaning that in following turns you can use the Vindictive Strategy Stratagem to ensure those crucial shots reach their target.

# CULTIST MOB (10 MODELS)

- The Cultist Champion is equipped with:
- bolt pistol
- brutal assault weapon
- 9 Chaos Cultists are equipped with:
- autopistol
- brutal assault weapon

While this unit may be relatively unimpressive from an attacking standpoint, it performs two crucial roles in the battle. Firstly, as a Battleline unit, it is able to secure objectives, making it a great way to rack up a few extra VP and keep the front line in your opponent’s table half.

Secondly, although easily killed themselves, the Cultists can be used to block the enemy from achieving crucial charges against your more powerful units like the Possessed, setting the foe up for a vicious counterattack from your main units in return.# Combat Patrol - Zarkan’s Daemonkin

# COMBAT PATROL

# ZARKAN’S DAEMONKIN

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Zarkan’s Daemonkin can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Dark Pacts – which is described below.

# DARK PACTS

Beseeching the Chaos Gods with fanatical fervour, the profane champions of the Heretic Astartes pray for diabolic boons, promising the vilest of offerings in return for their power.

If your Army Faction is Heretic Astartes, each time a unit with this ability is selected to shoot or fight, it can make a Dark Pact. If it does, it must first take a Leadership test before any effects of that Dark Pact are resolved; if that test is failed, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. Then, select one of the following abilities for that unit’s weapons to gain until the end of the phase:

- Your Master of Possession model is your Warlord and has the Foul Zealotry Enhancement. You can replace this with Prey on the Weak.

# ENHANCEMENTS

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# FOUL ZEALOTRY

By eagerly embracing the worship of the Dark Gods and leading their followers in infernal rites of possession, Masters of Possession are gifted fell powers to bestow upon their most loyal servants.

Each time the bearer’s unit makes a Dark Pact, that unit’s weapons gain the [LETHAL HITS] and [SUSTAINED HITS 1] abilities until the end of the phase, instead of just gaining one of those abilities.

- [LETHAL HITS]
- [SUSTAINED HITS 1]

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# PREY ON THE WEAK

Masters of Possession wield their daemonic power with malicious glee, targeting the weak with gouts of soul‑searing witchfire to break their will.

In your Shooting phase, after the bearer has shot, select one enemy unit hit by one or more of those attacks made with a Rite of Possession. That enemy unit must take a Battle‑shock test and when doing so, subtract 1 from the result.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# MARKED FOR EXECUTION

Communing with daemonic entities, the Master of Possession is alerted to the presence of a powerful individual. This fated warrior must be destroyed, for their very presence risks undermining the fell rituals the daemoncult seek to enact.

When your opponent’s Warlord is destroyed, if you are in the first, second or third battle round, you score 12VP. Otherwise, you score 6VP.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# SITES OF POWER

Invisible to all save those gifted with witchsight, rippling ley‑lines of warp energy criss‑cross the battlefield. By seizing these sites of power the daemoncult may enact their macabre rituals with impunity.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your turn, you score 2VP if you control at least as many objective markers as your opponent does.

# STRATAGEMS

# VINDICTIVE STRATEGY

The Heretic Astartes give no quarter to the weak, pursuing their cowering foes with relentless brutality.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase.

TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes an attack that targets an enemy unit that is below its Starting Strength, re‑roll a Hit roll of 1. If that enemy unit is Below Half‑strength, re‑roll a Wound roll of 1 as well.

Cost: 1CP

# VIOLENT UNBINDING

The daemonic energies swirling within the Master of Possession are controlled by force of will alone. Upon death, these lethal powers are released to devastating effect.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an attack made by an enemy unit destroys your Master of Possession model, before removing it from play.

TARGET: Your Master of Possession model. You can use this Stratagem on that model even though it was just destroyed.

EFFECT: If that enemy unit is within 6" of your Master of Possession model, roll one D6: on a 2‑5, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds; on a 6, that enemy unit suffers 3 mortal wounds.

Cost: 1CP

# DAEMONIC FERVOUR

The daemons bound within each Possessed seek only to sate their thirst for carnage. Even the death of their physical host will not prevent them from achieving this goal.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

TARGET: One Possessed unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6. On a 4+, do not remove the destroyed model from play; it can fight after the attacking model’s unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.

Cost: 1CP
