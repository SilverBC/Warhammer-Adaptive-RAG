# Combat Patrol: Adepta Sororitas

# The Penitent Host

Canoness Ellyrine sees herself as a bringer of illumination and repentance through pain. She is a steel-willed and uncompromising zealot who judges herself and her followers almost as harshly as she does her foes. Inspired to furious rapture by their leader’s unwavering example, the Battle Sisters and penitents who follow her fight all the harder to prove themselves worthy of the God-Emperor’s grace.

- Shooting: Units can attack enemy units within range.
- Combat: Units can engage in close combat if they are within range of enemy units.

# Combat Patrol: Adepta Sororitas

# The Penitent Host

# Abilities

The datasheets required to use The Penitent Host can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Acts of Faith – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

# Acts of Faith

It is said the Emperor’s benediction touches the Adepta Sororitas, manifesting as a nimbus of holy light in which his power is revealed in miraculous deeds of fortitude and divine strength.

Each unit from your army can perform one Act of Faith per phase. This is done using Miracle dice.

# Gaining Miracle Dice

If your Army Faction is Adepta Sororitas, you gain 1 Miracle dice:

- Your Canoness model is your Warlord and has the Armour of Faith Enhancement. You can replace this with Saintly Relic.

# Default Enhancement

# Armour of Faith

This warrior’s faith is so fervent, her zeal so all-consuming, that by force of will alone she not only ignores injuries that should have laid her low thrice over, but also inspires her followers to do likewise.

- The bearer has the Feel No Pain 4+ ability. In addition, while the bearer is leading a unit, other models in that unit have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability.

# Miracle Dice Pool

At the start of each turn:

- Each time an Adepta Sororitas unit from your army is destroyed.

Each time you gain a Miracle dice, roll one D6. The number you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This value cannot be changed or re-rolled, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice to one side – this is your Miracle dice pool.

# Performing an Act of Faith

Before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled (this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:

- Advance roll
- Battle-shock test
- Charge roll
- Damage roll
- Hit roll
- Saving throw
- Wound roll

# Optional Enhancement

# Saintly Relic

The Imperium is a realm built upon the martyrdoms of countless saints. These figures of faith have inspired the creation of myriad relics said to be fashioned from their corporeal remains, and it is common practice amongst the war leaders of the Adepta Sororitas to bear them into battle. There they serve as foci of faith, their influence seeming to produce almost supernatural effects amidst the mayhem of war.

In your Command phase, if the bearer is not Battle-shocked and is within range of an objective marker you control, you gain one Miracle dice. In addition, while the bearer is on the battlefield, each time you gain a Miracle dice, you can re-roll that Miracle dice.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# DIVINE JUDGEMENT

Amongst the enemy ranks there are those whose heresies are so heinous that they must be struck down at all costs by the pious Sisters of Battle.

At the start of the first battle round, your opponent must select one unit from their army (excluding Monster and Vehicle units).

At the end of the battle, you score 6VP if that enemy unit is destroyed. If that enemy unit was destroyed by a melee attack made by an Adepta Sororitas model from your army, you score 10VP instead.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# RITES OF RECONSECRATION

The foe have overrun a site of great religious importance. It now falls to the warriors of the Adepta Sororitas to burn a path through their unclean ranks, secure the defiled holy ground, and reconsecrate it with prayer and the shed blood of the foe.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your turn, you score 3VP if one or more Adepta Sororitas units from your army that are not Battle-shocked are wholly within your opponent’s deployment zone.

# STRATAGEMS

# DIVINE PROTECTION

The Battle Sisters stride through the fires of battle as though the blessings of the God-Emperor protect them.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

COST: 1CP

TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, models in your unit have a 5+ invulnerable save, or a 4+ invulnerable save instead if your unit is a Battle Sisters Squad or a Seraphim Squad.

# HOLY CLEANSING

The warriors of the Adepta Sororitas smite their foes with hate-fuelled zeal as their hymns of battle ring out.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase.

COST: 1CP

TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas Infantry unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.

# MARTYR’S DEATH

There can be no better end for a Sister of Battle than to die a glorious martyr in the cause of the God-Emperor, striking down their foes unto their last breath.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

COST: 2CP

TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that model has not fought this phase, do not remove it from play. The destroyed model can fight after the attacking model’s unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet
