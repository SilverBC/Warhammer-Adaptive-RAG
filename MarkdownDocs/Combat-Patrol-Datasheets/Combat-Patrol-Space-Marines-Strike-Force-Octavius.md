# STRIKE FORCE OCTAVIUS

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Strike Force Octavius can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Oath of Moment – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

Your Captain model is your Warlord and has the Champion Duellist Enhancement. You can replace this with Oathsworn Determination.

# ENHANCEMENTS

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# OATH OF MOMENT

In battle, Space Marines swear mighty oaths to destroy the enemies of the Emperor and uphold the honour of their Chapter, and such vows are sacrosanct. When the Angels of Death strike, they do so with the precision of a surgeon and the force of a thunderbolt. Experience and strategic expertise help them to read the shifting shape of the battle with post-human speed and clarity, directing their wrath towards one priority target after another. Command assets are annihilated, leaving the enemy reeling leaderless. Heavy armour, potent artillery and the vaunted elites of the foe’s forces are laid waste with horrifying speed, until the Emperor’s Angels of Death stand victorious over a field of smouldering wreckage and bolt-riddled corpses, and honour is finally satisfied.

# CHAMPION DUELLIST

This warrior lord is a shining exemplar of the strength and nobility of the Space Marines. They seek out and face the greatest threats to their battle-brothers, striking the foe’s most fell champions down with expert swordsmanship.

The bearer’s melee weapons have the [PRECISION] and [LETHAL HITS] abilities.

At the start of your Command phase, select one unit from your opponent’s army. Until the start of your next Command phase, that enemy unit is your Oath of Moment target. Each time a model with this ability makes an attack that targets your Oath of Moment target, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# OATHSWORN DETERMINATION

Bellowing inspiring oaths to honour their Chapter and the Imperium, this master of battle leads their warriors in decisive conquests to wrest victory from the enemy no matter the odds.

Improve the Objective Control characteristic of models in the bearer’s unit by 1.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Information


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

You will use the Wrath of the Emperor secondary objective. You can replace this with Shock Tactics.

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# WRATH OF THE EMPEROR

Leading by masterful example, the commanders of the Space Marines descend on their foes with furious lethality. None must be left in any doubt that those of the Adeptus Astartes charged with strategic leadership are devastating warriors first and foremost.

At the end of each phase, you score 2VP if your Captain model destroyed one or more enemy models that phase.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# SHOCK TACTICS

The Space Marines are expert shock troops. In their deadly assaults, the Angels of Death smash aside the enemy to achieve their goals.

At the end of each player’s turn, you score 5VP if you control one or more objective markers that your opponent controlled at the start of that turn.

# STRATAGEMS

You can use the following Stratagems:

# GENE-WROUGHT RESILIENCE

# STRIKE FORCE OCTAVIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Combined with their ceramite armour, a Space Marine’s enhanced physiology can withstand even powerful attacks.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

COST: 1CP

TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, if the Strength characteristic of that attack is greater than your unit’s Toughness characteristic, subtract 1 from the Wound roll.

# VETERAN INSTINCTS

# STRIKE FORCE OCTAVIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Space Marine Terminators are veterans of hundreds of war zones and can recognise the weakness of Humanity’s many foes. Such experience can be drawn on in battle to crush the most stubborn of attackers.

WHEN: Fight phase.

COST: 1CP

TARGET: One Terminator unit from your army that has not been selected to fight this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes an attack, re-roll a Wound roll of 1. If that attack targets a Monster or Vehicle unit, you can re-roll the Wound roll instead.

# DUTY AND HONOUR

# STRIKE FORCE OCTAVIUS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Space Marines excel in daring strikes that unleash overwhelming force to dominate foes that often outnumber them. No sooner is one site purged than the battle-brothers surge on to the next, ever mindful of the foes yet to be killed.

WHEN: End of your Command phase.

COST: 1CP

TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that is within range of an objective marker you control.

EFFECT: That objective marker remains under your control, even if you have no models within range of it, until your opponent controls it at the start or end of any turn.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

Space Marine Captains are expected to fight from the front, and few kinds of armour enable them to do so as effectively as Terminator plate. Captain Octavius goes to battle clad in just such a mighty suit of armour, shrugging off the worst his enemies can hurl at him before carving them apart with his ancient relic blade.
