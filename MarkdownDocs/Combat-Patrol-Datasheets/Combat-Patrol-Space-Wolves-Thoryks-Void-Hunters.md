# COMBAT PATROL: SPACE WOLVES

# THORYK’S VOID HUNTERS

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Thoryk’s Void Hunters can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Oath of Moment – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

Your Battle Leader model is your Warlord and has the Tireless Hunter Enhancement. You can replace this with Ferocious.

# ENHANCEMENTS

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# OATH OF MOMENT

In battle, Space Marines swear mighty oaths to destroy the enemies of the Emperor and uphold the honour of their Chapter, and such vows are sacrosanct. When the Angels of Death strike, they do so with the precision of a surgeon and the force of a thunderbolt. Experience and strategic expertise help them to read the shifting shape of the battle with post-human speed and clarity, directing their wrath towards one priority target after another. Command assets are annihilated, leaving the enemy reeling leaderless. Heavy armour, potent artillery and the vaunted elites of the foe’s forces are laid waste with horrifying speed, until the Emperor’s Angels of Death stand victorious over a field of smouldering wreckage and bolt-riddled corpses, and honour is finally satisfied.

# TIRELESS HUNTER

Once this warrior has the scent of their quarry, they will pursue them doggedly and fight with cold ferocity to bring them down.

At the start of the first battle round, select one enemy unit. Each time the bearer makes an attack that targets that unit, add 1 to the Wound roll.

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# FEROCIOUS

Ever eager to wet his blade with the enemy’s blood, this fierce combatant launches themselves into close-quarters battle at the slightest opportunity.

You can target the bearer’s unit with the Heroic Intervention Stratagem for 0CP, and can do so even if you have already used that Stratagem on a different unit this phase.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# MIGHTY SAGA

Every Space Wolf hopes one day to perform great deeds worthy of a memorable saga. Chief amongst such potential achievements is the slaying of a great beast or fell champion of the foe.

At the start of the first battle round, select one enemy Character, Monster or Vehicle model.

At the end of the battle, you score 8VP if that enemy model is destroyed. If that enemy unit was destroyed by your Battle Leader model, you score 12VP instead.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# REIVING CONQUERORS

Even before their recruitment into the Chapter, those who will become Space Wolves fight amongst the ranks of Fenris’ warring tribes and learn to seize their foes’ territories in swift and decisive raids. These ingrained lessons never leave them.

At the end of your opponent’s turn, you score 3VP if you control at least one objective marker in No Man’s Land and you control at least as many objective markers in No Man’s Land as your opponent does.

# STRATAGEMS

# A WARRIOR’S DEATH

Space Wolves fight to the bloodied end, gladly embracing what they see as a good death earned in battle.

1CP

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6. On a 4+, do not remove the destroyed model from play; it can fight after the attacking model’s unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.

# KEEN SENSES

Even by the standards of Space Marines, Space Wolves’ ability to scent their foes and perceive them in low light conditions is remarkable. It makes them all but impossible to hide from.

1CP

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [IGNORES COVER] ability and each time a model in your unit makes an attack that targets a Character unit, re-roll a Hit roll of 1.

# PACK AMBUSH

The first the enemy knows of their peril is a fusillade from the shadows that smashes warriors from their feet. Then the howling begins from all around, and the terror sets in…

1CP

WHEN: Your Shooting phase, just after a Reiver Squad unit from your army has finished making its attacks.

TARGET: One enemy unit that was hit by one or more of those attacks and is not within Engagement Range of that Reiver Squad unit.

EFFECT: That enemy unit must take a Battle-shock test. When doing so, subtract 2 from the result.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

In the Space Wolves Chapter, Lieutenants are often known as Wolf Guard Battle Leaders. Heroes such as Thoryk epitomise both the predatory fury and the hard-won martial skill for which their Chapter is known, and against even the greatest horrors their courage is as unbreakable as Fenrisian bedrock.
