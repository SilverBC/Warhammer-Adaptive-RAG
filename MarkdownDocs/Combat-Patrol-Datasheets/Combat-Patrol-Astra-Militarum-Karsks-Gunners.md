# COMBAT PATROL: ASTRA MILITARUM

# KARSK’S GUNNERS

The soldiers gathered under Major Karsk’s banner are but one small part of the far larger Astra Militarum

# Unit Type

# Cadian Veteran Guardsmen

Unit Number: 2# Combat Patrol: Astra Militarum - Karsk’s Gunners

# COMBAT PATROL: ASTRA MILITARUM

# KARSK’S GUNNERS

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Karsk’s Gunners can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Voice of Command – that is referenced on the Command Squad Karsk datasheet, and is described below.

Your Officer model is your Warlord and has the Command Laurels Enhancement. You can replace this with Gunnery Officer.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# VOICE OF COMMAND

Raised and trained to instil unwavering obedience, officers of the Imperial Guard command authority and respect, and issue orders with imperious bellows that cut through the clamour of war.

In your Command phase, Officer models from your army with this ability can issue Orders. Each Officer’s datasheet will specify how many Orders it can issue and which units are eligible to receive those Orders. Each time an Officer model issues an Order, select one of the Orders below, then select one eligible friendly unit within 6" of that Officer model to issue it to.

# COMMAND LAURELS

Only by exhibiting exceptional strategic and tactical awareness in multiple engagements can an officer earn this award. Such an august commander can be expected to extend their coordinating influence effortlessly across the battlefield.

In your Command phase, if the bearer is on the battlefield, you gain 1CP. In addition, each time the bearer issues an Order, it is issued to all friendly Astra Militarum units on the battlefield.

Until the start of your next Command phase, the unit you selected is affected by that Order. Unless otherwise stated, a unit can only be affected by one Order at a time (any Order subsequently issued to that unit replaces the current one). If a unit being affected by an Order becomes Battle-shocked, that Order ceases to affect that unit.

- Move! Move! Move! - Add 3" to the Move characteristic of models in this unit.
- Take Aim! - Improve the Ballistic Skill characteristic of ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit by 1.
- Take Cover! - Improve the Save characteristic of models in this unit by 1 (this cannot improve a model’s Save to better than 3+).

# OR

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# GUNNERY OFFICER (AURA)

Having risen through the ranks of an artillery regiment, this officer is an expert in siting, concealing then commanding the fire of heavy field pieces. The resulting devastation amongst the foe is never less than spectacular.

In your Command phase, if the bearer is on the battlefield, you gain 1CP. In addition, while a friendly Artillery unit is within 6" of the bearer’s unit:

- Each time you roll to determine the number of attacks a model in that Artillery unit makes with a weapon, you can re-roll the result.
- Models in that Artillery unit have the Lone Operative ability if they have not made any attacks yet this battle.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# HOLD THE LINE

Once the Astra Militarum have drawn up their fighting lines it is their sworn duty to dig in and prevent the enemy from overrunning their positions no matter the cost in lives.

At the end of your opponent’s turn, you score 3VP if there are no enemy units wholly within your deployment zone (excluding Battle-shocked units). If there are no enemy units wholly within 6" of your deployment zone (excluding Battle-shocked units), you score 5VP instead.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# METHODICAL DESTRUCTION

The Tactica Imperialis emphasises the importance of focusing the firepower of your warriors upon a single enemy target unto its absolute destruction, before switching to the elimination of the next.

At the start of the battle round, select one enemy unit that is not destroyed to be your army’s target for that battle round. At the end of that battle round, you score 4VP if your army’s target for that battle round is destroyed.

# STRATAGEMS

# SEND IN THE NEXT WAVE

# KARSK’S GUNNERS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Amongst the greatest strengths of the Astra Militarum is its sheer numerical might. There are always more bodies to be hurled into the meat-grinder of battle.

1CP

WHEN: Reinforcements step of your Movement phase.

TARGET: One destroyed Cadian Shock Troops unit from your army. You can use this Stratagem on that unit even though it is destroyed.

EFFECT: Add a new unit to your army identical to your destroyed unit, at its original Starting Strength. Set that unit up anywhere on the battlefield wholly within 9" of your battlefield edge and not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.

# BRING IT DOWN

# KARSK’S GUNNERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Prioritising a vital enemy target, the Astra Militarum soldiery focus all their fury upon it.

1CP

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

TARGET: Any number of Astra Militarum units from your army, and one enemy unit.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in one of your selected units makes an attack that targets that enemy unit, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

# ARTILLERY STRIKE

# KARSK’S GUNNERS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Big guns behind the Imperial lines rain down a disruption bombardment upon the foe. As the ground shakes and debris fountains skywards, the enemy are thrown into disarray.

2CP

WHEN: Start of your opponent’s Command phase.

TARGET: One Officer model from your army.

EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, halve the Move characteristic of enemy models, halve Advance rolls made for enemy units, enemy units cannot declare a charge and each time an enemy model makes a ranged attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.

RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this Stratagem once per battle.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

Major Karsk is every bit the unforgiving and grizzled Cadian commander of the propaganda vid-feeds. Though given at times to the odd flourish of grim gallows humour, he is typically stern and disciplined. A gifted strategist, he is accompanied by a cadre of specialist troopers who aid him in his command duties.
