# Combat Patrol: Leagues of Votann

# Warspeke’s Prospect

Campaigning across the stars as part of a Prospect – a Kin scouting and prospecting fleet – Kâhl Warspeke and his comrades fight to secure those resources or technologies they assess as valuable enough to be worth the lives and effort.

# COMBAT PATROL: LEAGUES OF VOTANN

# WARSPEKE’S PROSPECT

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Warspeke’s Prospect can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Eye of the Ancestors – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

Your Kâhl model is your Warlord and has the Waste Feeds the Void Enhancement. You can replace this with Prâgmaat Comms Uplink.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# EYE OF THE ANCESTORS

The Kin are a highly practical people in every area of life, not least in war. Their leaders make swift and careful calculations before and during battle, constantly striving to determine if the potential reward of conflict is worth the inevitable loss of resources and precious Kin lives. An essential part of this is what is known as casting the Eye of the Ancestors, through which Kin commanders assess the greatest enemy threats, mark weak points in their defences and determine what forces are needed to overcome both.

# WASTE FEEDS THE VOID

One of the many Kin Truths, this saying is an admonition against frivolous expenditure of all sorts, ammunition included. It is an idiom this warrior has taken to heart and one they have drilled into their warriors until careful and steady shot-placement has become second nature. So steady and relentless has their marksmanship become that they can maintain a punishing hail of fire whether on the advance or staging a tactical retreat.

- Each time an enemy unit destroys a Leagues of Votann unit from your army, that enemy unit gains 1 Judgement token. An enemy unit can never have more than 2 Judgement tokens (any further Judgement tokens a unit would gain beyond this are ignored).
- Each time a model in the bearer’s unit makes a ranged attack, re-roll a Hit roll of 1. In addition, the bearer’s unit is eligible to shoot in a turn in which it Fell Back.

# Judgement Tokens

Each time a model from your army makes an attack that targets a unit that has one or more Judgement tokens, until that model’s attacks have been resolved, apply the relevant bonus from the table below to that attack.

|JUDGEMENT TOKENS|BONUS|
|---|---|
|1|Eminent Threat: Add 1 to the Hit roll.|
|2|Now We’ve Got a Grudge to Settle: Add 1 to the Hit roll and add 1 to the Wound roll.|

Designer’s Note: If a unit with Judgement tokens is removed from the battlefield, make a note of how many Judgement tokens it had when it was removed. If that unit is set up on the battlefield again, place the corresponding number of Judgement tokens next to it. If a unit with Judgement tokens splits up into two or more smaller units, each of those units gains a number of Judgement tokens equal to that of the original unit. If two units combine to form a single larger unit and either of those units had Judgement tokens, make a note of how many the unit with the most has, just before they combine – the new unit has a number of Judgement tokens equal to this.

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# PRÂGMAAT COMMS UPLINK

A hardened communications rig has been worked into this warrior’s armour and loaded with priority override boosters. This ensures that the Kin on the battlefield who most needs up-to-the-minute strategic and tactical updates can cut through any lower-priority exchanges to acquire them.

- Add 1 to the Objective Control characteristic of models in the bearer’s unit.
- In addition, you can re-roll Battle-shock tests taken for the bearer’s unit.# Warhammer 40K Gameplay Information


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

You will use the Toil Earns secondary objective. You can replace this with Settle a Grudge.

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# TOIL EARNS

Once the Kin have set their sights on a particular goal, they will fight with bloody minded tenacity to hold it. In their estimation, whoever works hardest to claim that vital battlefield asset has an inarguable right to its possession.

Before the battle, at the start of the Deploy Armies step, you must select one objective marker that is not in your deployment zone.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your turn, you score 4VP if you control that objective marker.

# STRATAGEMS

# PAYMENT IN KIND

WARSPEKE’S PROSPECT – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Striking a telling blow against the Kin is a sure way to paint a target on one’s own back, both as a priority for elimination and a worthy recipient of some aggravated payback.

COST: 1CP

WHEN: Any phase.

TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit from your army that was just destroyed by an attack made by an enemy model. You can use this Stratagem on that Leagues of Votann unit even though it was just destroyed.

EFFECT: Until the end of the battle, each time a Leagues of Votann model from your army makes an attack that targets that enemy model’s unit, re-roll a Hit roll of 1.

# PAN-SPECTRAL SWEEP

WARSPEKE’S PROSPECT – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The multifunctional pan-spectral scanners employed by the Kin lay bare weak points in the enemy’s defences.

COST: 1CP

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.

# SKEINWROUGHT PHYSIOLOGY

WARSPEKE’S PROSPECT – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The cloneskeins laced through the genetic makeup of the Kin render them hardy and durable in the extreme.

COST: 1CP

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, improve the Save characteristic of models in your unit by 1.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# SETTLE A GRUDGE

The Kin declare a grudge only in the most extreme circumstances, when such grave insult has been given that the pragmatic calculus of battle must be cast aside in favour of the enemy’s utter annihilation at any price. Once they have made this commitment, however, nothing short of death will halt their coldly methodical dismantlement of their enemies.

From the second battle round onwards, at the start of the battle round, select one enemy unit that is not destroyed and has one or more Judgement tokens to be your army’s target for that battle round. At the end of that battle round, you score 4VP if your army’s target for that battle round is destroyed.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

Kâhl Warspeke’s strategic wisdom, determination and martial might inspire his warriors. He fights with a mixture of skill and brute force, bludgeoning with his mass gauntlet those foes not obliterated by his volkanite disintegrator, and impatiently shrugging off the blasts and blades of his enemies through sheer armoured fortitude.

Well-armoured, well-trained and equipped with an array of powerful weaponry, Hearthkyn Warriors form the backbone of most Oathbands. Led by their Theyns, they lay down hails of firepower, shrugging off the enemy’s return volleys before storming in to shatter their wavering foes for good.

Hernkyn Pioneers skim across alien worlds and scout enemy positions, riding on their magna-coil bikes. Fast, resilient, and possessed of formidable firepower, these far-ranging bands of warriors often strike at the foe from unexpected quarters, or send back intelligence on enemy movements to their Oathband’s Kâhl.
