# COMBAT PATROL: TYRANIDS

# THE VARDENGHAST SWARM

Categorised an alpha-class threat by Imperial cryptosavants after a series of brutal battles along the
Vardenghast Line, this swarm of Tyranid warrior organisms has reaped a bloody toll of Human prey.
Flowing into the fight like a single, many-bodied entity, these vicious aliens swiftly close the distance
to their enemies before riddling them with gruesome bio-ammunition or tearing them limb from limb.

# Warhammer 40K - Fleshborer Termagants

# Unit Overview

The Fleshborer Termagants are a type of unit in the Warhammer 40K tabletop game, known for their rapid-fire capabilities and swarm tactics.

# Attributes

|Attribute|Value|
|---|---|
|A|C|
|B|E|
|C|D|

# Gameplay Rules

Fleshborer Termagants follow specific rules during gameplay, including movement, shooting, and combat mechanics.

# Movement

Termagants can move up to a certain distance each turn, allowing them to close in on the enemy or reposition strategically.

# Shooting

Equipped with Fleshborers, these units can unleash a barrage of shots at their enemies, making them effective at range.

# Combat

In close combat, Termagants can engage in melee, although they are primarily designed for ranged attacks.# Combat Patrol: Tyranids - The Vardenghast Swarm

# COMBAT PATROL: TYRANIDS

# THE VARDENGHAST SWARM

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use the Vardenghast Swarm can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Synapse – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet. You can also use the Shadow in the Warp ability. Both of these abilities are described below.

Your Winged Tyranid Prime model is your Warlord and has the Psychostatic Veil Enhancement. You can replace this with Secretion Goad.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# SYNAPSE

Some Tyranids serve as synaptic conduits or nodal relays through which a portion of the Hive Mind’s iron will flows, overriding the natural instincts of the swarm to direct the teeming warrior-beasts to function as a single, gestalt organism on the battlefield.

While a Tyranids unit from your army is within 6" of one or more friendly Synapse models, that Tyranids unit is said to be within Synapse Range of those models and of your army. Each time a Tyranids unit from your army takes a Battle-shock test, if it is within Synapse Range of your army, take that test on 3D6 instead of 2D6.

# SHADOW IN THE WARP

Tyranids flood the battlefield with the psychic signature of the hive fleet, an icy, alien dread that gnaws at the minds of their prey and smothers even the most stalwart courage. When faced with such unfathomable horror, many are driven insane or suffer catastrophic neural damage.

# PSYCHOSTATIC VEIL

Grotesque neuro-symbiotes squirm through the encephalitic meat of this organism’s cranial node. They emit a nauseating barrage of localised psychostatic that triggers dread, revulsion and visual hallucinations in nearby prey. Foes whose only chance is to steady their aim and strike true against this vile monster instead stagger back, weapons falling from shaking hands, survival instincts drowned by a flood of panic and pain.

The bearer has the Lone Operative ability and a 4+ invulnerable save. In addition, each time a melee attack targets the bearer, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.

Once per battle, in either player’s Command phase, if one or more units from your army with this ability are on the battlefield, you can unleash the Shadow in the Warp. When you do, each enemy unit on the battlefield must take a Battle-shock test.

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# SECRETION GOAD

By palpitating a bio-implant within its thoracic cavity, this creature is able to trigger a surge of hyper-acidic secretions in the venom glands of nearby warrior organisms. Battle armour and flesh alike bubble and dissolve under this sudden caustic onslaught.

Once per turn, when a friendly Tyranids unit within 6" of the bearer is selected to shoot or fight, the bearer can use this ability. If it does, until the end of the phase, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of weapons equipped by models in that friendly unit by 1.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# Secondary Objectives

# Default Secondary Objective

# Alpha Xenoform

This organism is linked to the ineffable alien might of the Hive Mind and serves as a conduit of its will. There is no action it takes nor dread deed of butchery it performs that does not further – on however minor a scale – the designs of the wider galactic super-predator.

At the end of each phase, you score 4VP if your Winged Tyranid Prime model destroyed one or more enemy models that phase.

# Optional Secondary Objective

# Chitinous Tide

Tyranids attack in living waves of predatory warrior organisms whose only impulse is to overwhelm and tear apart their foes. Allowing such an enemy to break through your defence lines and choke off your routes of retreat is a sure way to seal your own doom.

At the end of your turn, you score 5VP if you control one or more objective markers that are within 6" of your opponent’s deployment zone.

# Stratagems

# Battle Tactic Stratagems

# Hyper-Reactive

Inhumanly swift reaction times and tensile muscle-spasms allow the warrior organisms to weave and dodge around their foes’ attacks.

|WHEN|TARGET|EFFECT|
|---|---|---|
|Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.|One Tyranids Infantry unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.|Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.|

# Voracious Assault

(Details not provided)

# Strategic Ploy Stratagems

# Teeming Broods

Numerous, expendable and seemingly without number, fresh waves of Termagants flow into battle by the minute.

|WHEN|TARGET|EFFECT|
|---|---|---|
|The Reinforcements step of your Movement phase.|One Termagants unit from your army. You can use this Stratagem on that unit even if it is destroyed.|If your unit is not destroyed, return up to D6 destroyed models to it. Otherwise, add a new unit to your army identical to your destroyed unit, in Strategic Reserves, containing 2D6 models.|# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

# TERROR OF VARDENGHAST

|T| |SV|W|LD|OC| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|12"|5|4+|6|7+|1| |

As a Tyranid Prime, the Terror of Vardenghast possesses all the physical and synaptic might of an alpha war-beast while also boasting the frightening speed and manoeuvrability imparted by its huge leathery wings. Swooping down into the midst of the foe, it rends and tears until naught remains but corpses and fleeing prey.

These monsters stampede into battle with frightening speed. They devour any prey organism in their paths, but especially favour those victims with psychic abilities. How they metabolise such esoteric powers is unclear, but doing so allows them to project surges of psychocorrosive ash that deflagrate their victims’ minds and souls.

Scuttling predators that attack in huge swarms, Termagants were originally spawned to roam the tight arterial passages of hive ships and hunt intruders. They harry their prey with a hail of firepower, seeking always to outflank and envelop their victims as they erode their numbers.

At the start of the Declare Battle Formations step, before any units have been set up, this unit can be split into two units, each containing ten models.

Skulking Horrors: Once per turn, when an enemy unit ends a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move within 9" of this unit, if this unit is not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units, it can make a Normal move of up to D6".

Barbgaunts are little more than living weapons, their bodies and barblaunchers slaved to the will of a pulsating ganglio-parasite that piggybacks them into battle. There, they unleash volleys of chitinous barbs that detonate with the fury of violent muscle-spasms and transfix nearby victims with hails of jagged projectiles.

Disruption Bombardment: In your Shooting phase, after this unit has shot, select one enemy Infantry unit hit by one or more of those attacks. Until the end of your opponent’s next turn, that enemy unit is disrupted. While a unit is disrupted, subtract 2 from its Move characteristic and subtract 2 from Advance and Charge rolls made for it.

Stealthy hunters and expert ambushers, Von Ryan’s Leapers are swift, agile and especially lethal when fighting in dense terrain. Akin to living mines, they lie in wait at the optimum locations to cause as much damage as possible. When they sense the perfect time to strike, they burst forth to butcher all around in a murderous frenzy.
