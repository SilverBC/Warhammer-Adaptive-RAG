# Combat Patrol: Aeldari

# The Fatebreakers

# Abilities

The datasheets required to use the Fatebreakers can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Strands of Fate – that is referenced on many unit’s datasheets, and is described below.

# STRANDS OF FATE

The Aeldari live on the brink of extinction. As such, their Farseers have become adept at reading future events, seeing the many strands of fate ahead of their people and the consequences of following each one. Taken at the right time, a simple action can avoid calamitous outcomes, aiding the Aeldari in their continued struggle for survival.

Your Farseer model is your Warlord and has the Foresight Enhancement. You can replace this with Eldritch Might.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# FORESIGHT (PSYCHIC)

It is within the gift of Aeldari Farseers to perceive the strands of fate and the fractured web they weave into the future. The truly gifted can manipulate the weft of the pattern, perceiving that which will come to pass and directing their followers accordingly.

At the start of the battle, make a Strands of Fate roll by rolling twelve D6.

If you wish, you can then re-roll all of these dice, but if you do, roll one less D6. You can continue re-rolling all of the dice in this manner, rolling one less D6 each time you do, until you are satisfied with the results rolled (or until you only have a single D6 remaining).

Once per turn, you can target the bearer’s unit with the Fire Overwatch Stratagem for 0CP. If the bearer’s unit is within range of an objective marker you control, hits are scored on unmodified Hit rolls of 4+ while resolving that Stratagem. Otherwise, hits are scored on unmodified Hit rolls of 5+ while resolving that Stratagem.

When you are satisfied with the results rolled, those remaining dice become your Fate dice for the battle. These results cannot be changed or re-rolled further, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Fate dice to one side – this is your Fate dice pool.

Before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army with the Strands of Fate ability, if you have one or more dice in your Fate dice pool, you can use one of those Fate dice. To do so, select one of those Fate dice to substitute that dice roll. The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Fate dice is used as if it had been rolled (this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Fate dice can only be used in this way once. After using a Fate dice, remove it from your Fate dice pool and roll all remaining dice that are part of that dice roll (if any). You can use Fate dice for any of the following types of dice roll:

- Advance roll
- Battle-shock test
- Charge roll
- Damage roll
- Hit roll
- Saving throw
- Wound roll

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# ELDRITCH MIGHT (PSYCHIC)

This warrior’s psychic might is especially great, and further augmented by the cold rage they feel towards all those seeking to hasten the extinction of the Aeldari peoples. They unleash these prodigious powers upon their foes without mercy or hesitation, raking them with leaping bolts of emerald lightning or driving them to madness with ghostly hallucinations.

Each time the bearer makes a Psychic attack, re-roll a Hit roll of 1, re-roll a Wound roll of 1 and re-roll a Damage roll of 1.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# INEFFABLE AGENDA

The battle plans of the Asuryani are informed by the prophetic insights of their Farseers and honed with eldritch alien wisdom. Even as their actions may seem like madness to their foes, in truth every move made by the Aeldari brings them closer to victory.

At the end of your turn, you score 3VP if you control one or more objective markers that are not within your deployment zone and that you did not control at the start of the turn.

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# A GREATER DESTINY

The battle being fought here is but a step upon a longer road, that leads on into the shadows of a future still to be shaped. The foe are merely obstructions to be neutralised or bypassed.

At the end of the battle, you score 10VP if one or more units from your army (excluding Battle-shocked units) are wholly within your opponent’s deployment zone.

# STRATAGEMS

# WHIP-FAST REACTIONS

So fast are the reactions of the Aeldari that they can dodge the bullets, blasts and blades of their enemies with insulting ease.

|COST|WHEN|TARGET|EFFECT|
|---|---|---|---|
|1CP|Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.|One Aeldari Infantry or Aeldari Mounted unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.|Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.|

# STORM OF SHOTS

With eerie synchronicity, the Aeldari focus their fire into a punishing hail that suddenly and completely eradicates its luckless target.

|COST|WHEN|TARGET|EFFECT|
|---|---|---|---|
|1CP|Your Shooting phase.|Up to two Aeldari Mounted units from your army, or one Aeldari Infantry unit from your army.|Until the end of the phase, each time a model in one of those units makes an attack, add 1 to the Hit roll.|

# ZEPHYR-SWIFT

Trying to fight the Aeldari is like doing battle with smoke and air. Moving with incredible swiftness and agility, they have struck and faded again before their enemies even register their presence.

|COST|WHEN|TARGET|EFFECT|RESTRICTIONS|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1CP|End of your Shooting phase.|Up to two Aeldari Mounted units from your army that are not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units, or one Aeldari Infantry unit from your army that is not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.|Each of those units can make a Normal move of up to 6".|Until the end of the turn, those units are not eligible to declare a charge.|# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

Iraneth’s followers look to her for leadership in battle. Her psychic abilities allow her to uncover the enemy’s intentions and calculate the effects of their attacks. Her mind is her greatest weapon, for with a thought she can summon terrifying storms of coruscating eldritch energy or manipulate the causality of fate itself.

The jetbikes ridden by the Windriders can cross leagues in the space of a few heartbeats, and to master such incredible machines takes great skill.
