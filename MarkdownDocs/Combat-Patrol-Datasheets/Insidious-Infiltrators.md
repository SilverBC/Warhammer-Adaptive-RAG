# WARHAMMER 40K

Night had fallen on Drovok. Two moons illuminated the mining complex. Caught in the glare of the twin satellites, the geometric shapes of cranes, hoists, drilling towers and gantries cast criss-crossing shadows across the white, dusty ground. As smog clouds passed in front of one moon, so the shadows shifted. When the clouds covered both, the complex descended into near total darkness.

‘Leapers!’ The sound, uttered by one of the Hearthkyn Warriors, meant nothing to the Lictor or its lesser brood creatures. It was merely another noise amidst the clamour that now filled the compound. Ion blasters blazed, tinting everything a cyan blue. Blasts of energy tore through the Leapers, atomising limbs and splattering black ichor across the white ground. The surviving Leapers, undaunted, covered the distance to the Kin with horrific speed, their razor-sharp claws glinting in the moonlight as they lunged. They punched their talons through armour, flesh and internal organs, flinging blood and viscera in glittering red arcs. More prey, alerted by the alarm, raced from nearby buildings to aid their kin, smouldering axes raised. Unobserved amidst the carnage, a shadow beneath one of the cranes shifted. The Tyranid, its skin black as midnight, turned grey, then white as it stalked swiftly across the compound and entered the command centre of the mining complex. The screaming began soon after as the Neurolictor went about its grisly business.

Secreting itself behind the cab of a heavy mining vehicle, the Tyranid observed its prey. It did not know what they were called, or what the symbols on their armour meant. It did not know that it did not need to know these facts to enact the will of the Hive Mind. Instead, it sensed. The nest of worm-like tendrils that hung from its upper jaw writhed back and forth as the creature took in its foes’ oily musk and the sweat that clung to their craggy faces. Its auditory senses picked up vibrations in the air as they conversed. Even in the darkness, its multitude of eyes recorded every detail about them, from their squat statures and the orange armour they wore to the power plants on their backs and the heavy black boxes that they carried. The creature understood, deep in what passed for its brain, that the boxes were the equivalent of ranged bio-weapons and that they could cause significant damage to its body. These facts did not worry it, for the Tyranid did not understand the concepts of anxiety or fear. It did, however, understand caution. Hunkering down amongst the vehicle’s hydraulic pipes and electrical cables, the Lictor bided its time and waited for the Kin of the Trans-Hyperian Alliance to move just that little bit closer.

The smog clouds, driven by a harsh wind, unveiled both moons simultaneously, and the landscape was bathed with light once more – as too was the brood of lesser Tyranids that had snuck into the compound. The Lictor blinked as a wave of sensory information assailed it – the dismayed cry of its prey, the piercing blare of an alarm, the cracking discharge of weapons followed closely by the sharp ozonic tang of ionised air. The scent of adrenaline, heavy and pungent, reached it soon after. A synaptic imperative coalesced in its mind, and the Lictor knew with absolute clarity what it must do. It began to unfold its limbs.

# Full Rules for Fielding the Insidious Infiltrators

The arrival of Tyranid hive ships in a planetary system is, more often than not, the moment a world’s inhabitants realise they are about to be invaded by implacable extragalactic aliens. Little do they know, however, that their planet has almost certainly already been compromised. Sent ahead of the main Tyranid fleet, specially adapted vanguard organisms make landfall and infiltrate the enemy’s positions. There they will take out key targets as instructed by the Hive Mind, while assimilating vital knowledge on the planet’s defences. Such insidious and horrific tactics invariably sow fear and confusion among the enemy’s ranks.

Over the next few pages, you will find new rules for fielding the Insidious Infiltrators in your games of Combat Patrol. These enhancements, stratagems and secondary objectives represent this on the tabletop. As a strike force, the Insidious Infiltrators are swift, deadly in combat and extremely good at stealing objectives, but you’ll need to close the distance with the enemy swiftly, because these infiltrators don’t carry any ranged weapons at all!# Warhammer 40K - Insidious Infiltrators

# Insidious Infiltrators

|Unit|Model Count|Equipment|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Death’s Shadow|(1 MODEL)|piercing claws and talons|While somewhat weaker than the Lictor in terms of its offensive capabilities, the Neurolictor is a very powerful support beast. With the Shadow in the Warp ability, it can trigger widespread Battle-shock tests in your opponent’s army, which can make it impossible for some of your opponent’s key units to fire Overwatch at your softer units, such as the Von Ryan’s Leapers. It can also pick off less-durable characters, such as those with a Toughness characteristic of 3 or those that have already suffered a few wounds. Knowing when to throw the Neurolictor into combat and when not to is an important skill to learn.|
|Lictor|(1 MODEL)|claws and talons|The Lictor is your primary damage-dealing model, able to absolutely savage enemy characters with its Precision attacks as well as thinning down most other infantry units, excluding a few tougher examples such as Terminator Squads. Remember that the Lictor lacks an invulnerable save, however, so it is a good idea to keep it away from massed, high-AP attacks. Should your opponent be fielding a large Monster or Vehicle unit, the Lictor is also a prime candidate for the Swift Kills Stratagem, as it has enough attacks with a Damage of 2 that you should be able to reliably deal several wounds to such large prey.|
|Von Ryan’s Leapers|(3 MODELS)|Leaper’s talons|Von Ryan’s Leapers make up the bulk of the models in your force, and they are very flexible units. They are fast and able to deliver a decent punch, but do not expect them to stop power-armoured units on their own. For such adversaries, you will likely need to bring concentrated force to bear, focusing multiple units from your army on a single part of your opponent’s battle line. While your secondary objectives are focused around eliminating various parts of the opposing force, the Pheromonal Trace Stratagem still allows you to secure objective markers as your Von Ryan’s Leapers pass them on the way into combat. This can be a very useful tool to rack up some Victory points and can often be what turns an otherwise close loss into a well-fought victory.|
|Von Ryan’s Leapers|(3 MODELS)|Leaper’s talons|With three units of Von Ryan’s Leapers, you have a good degree of flexibility in your Combat Patrol, but this does not mean they should be squandered. Each will take a chunk out of whatever unit they assault, but they will likely take a solid amount of damage in return. As such, working out where and when to spend the lives of your Leapers needs to be carefully thought out. With so many infiltrating units, you are unlikely to be able to deploy all three units into the thick of the fighting without at least one of them finding itself out in the open and vulnerable to enemy fire at the start of the game. It is therefore often best to exploit the Leapers’ high Move characteristic and stagger their deployment across the battlefield.|# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol - Insidious Infiltrators

# COMBAT PATROL

# INSIDIOUS INFILTRATORS

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use the Insidious Infiltrators can be found on the following pages. They are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Shadow in the Warp – that is referenced on a unit’s datasheet and described below.

# SHADOW IN THE WARP

Tyranids flood the battlefield with the psychic signature of the hive fleet – an icy, alien dread that gnaws at the minds of their prey and smothers even the most stalwart courage. When faced with such unfathomable horror, many are driven insane or suffer catastrophic neural damage.

Once per battle, in either player’s Command phase, if one or more units from your army with this ability are on the battlefield, you can unleash the Shadow in the Warp. When you do, each enemy unit on the battlefield must take a Battle-shock test.

# NEUROGOAD

Employing its subservient organisms as extensions of its own weapon limbs, the Neurolictor instinctively drives them to launch sudden terror attacks and increase the panic of its prey.

In your Command phase, select one friendly Tyranids unit within 12" of the bearer. Until the start of your next Command phase, you can re-roll Charge rolls made for that unit, and each time a model in that unit makes an attack, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

# ENHANCEMENTS

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

Your Neurolictor model is your Warlord and has the Neurogoad Enhancement. You can replace this with Psionic Phantoms.

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# PSIONIC PHANTOMS

Magnifying the terror of its prey, the Neurolictor causes them to hallucinate, projecting phantom doppelgängers into their peripheral vision and leaving them firing at nothing as it fades back into the shadows.

Once per battle round, when the bearer is selected as the target of one or more shooting attacks made by models from an enemy unit, it can use this Enhancement. If it does, it can make a Normal move of up to 6". If the bearer is then no longer visible to that enemy unit, roll one D6; on a 1–3, the models targeting the bearer can select new targets for their attacks. On a 4–6, the models targeting the bearer cannot select new targets for their attacks and so do not make any attacks this phase.

# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

You will use the Alpha Predation secondary objective. You can replace this with Left to Last.

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# ALPHA PREDATION

These organisms are driven to hunt down and slay whoever leads the prey, understanding that doing so quickly will shatter their victims’ cohesion and prevent their escape.

|BATTLE ROUND|VP SCORED|
|---|---|
|1–2|15|
|3–4|10|
|5|5|

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# LEFT TO LAST

Instinctively these organisms know the value of heightening their quarry’s terror, slaying bodyguards and underlings until only the prey leader remains amongst a field of butchered corpses. Only then will the Tyranids descend to feed upon the fear-softened mind of their true prey.

While the enemy Warlord is not destroyed, you score 4VP each time you destroy an enemy unit.

# STRATAGEMS

You can use the following Stratagems:

# SWIFT KILLS

Operating alone behind the prey’s battle lines, these organisms strike with swift precision to eliminate key threats to their ongoing hunt.

Cost: 1CP

WHEN: Fight phase.

TARGET: One Tyranids unit from your army that has not been selected to fight this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of melee weapons equipped by models in your unit by 1 and those weapons have the [ANTI-MONSTER 4+] and [ANTI-VEHICLE 4+] abilities.

# PHEROMONAL TRACE

Comparative isolation from the swarm triggers these organisms to produce powerful pheromones, akin to those left by Lictors, that will guide other warrior organisms to the prey site.

Cost: 1CP

WHEN: Your Command phase.

TARGET: One Von Ryan’s Leapers unit from your army.

EFFECT: Select one objective marker your unit is within range of and that you control. That objective marker is secured by you (see the main Combat Patrol rules).

# PREDATORS, NOT PREY

Even should the enemy corner these vicious organisms, still they cannot trammel them for long as the Tyranids dodge, slash and bound their way to freedom.

WHEN: Your Movement phase or your Charge phase.

TARGET: One Tyranids unit from your army that has not been selected to move this phase and has not declared a charge this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, models in your unit automatically pass Desperate Escape tests, and each time a model in your unit makes a move, it can move horizontally through models as if they were not there.# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

# Death’s Shadow

|M|T|SV|LD|OC|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|8"|5|4+|7|7+|

Named Death’s Shadow by the terrified garrison troops of Fort Angelosa, this Neurolictor has overseen vanguard raids on several worlds. The field of neural disruption it projects causes atavistic terror responses in even the most hardened prey, allowing it and its subservient organisms to sow blind panic behind enemy lines.

|MELEE WEAPONS|RANGE|A|WS|S|AP|D|ABILITIES|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Piercing claws and talons [PRECISION]|Melee|6|2+|6|-2|1|CORE: Infiltrators, Lone Operative, Stealth|

# Abilities

- Neural Disruption: In your Command phase, select one enemy unit within 12" of this model. That unit must take a Battle-shock test.
- Psychological Saboteur (Aura): While an enemy unit is within 12" of this model, if that unit is Battle-shocked:
- Each time a model in that unit makes an attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
- Each time a friendly Tyranids model makes an attack that targets that unit, add 1 to the Wound roll.
- Pouncing Leap: You can target this unit with the Heroic Intervention Stratagem for 0CP, and can do so even if you have already used that Stratagem on a different unit this phase.

Stealthy hunters and expert ambushers, Von Ryan’s Leapers are swift, agile and especially lethal when fighting in dense terrain. Akin to living mines, they lie still at the optimum locations to cause as much damage as possible. When they sense the perfect time to strike, they butcher all around in a murderous frenzy.
