# COMBAT PATROL: NECRONS

# AMONHOTEKH’S GUARD

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use Amonhotekh’s Guard can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Reanimation Protocols – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

Your Overlord model is your Warlord and has the Overriding Control Enhancement. You can replace this with Protocol of Resonant Focus.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# REANIMATION PROTOCOLS

The scattered dynasties of the Necrons pursue many different paths to dominance, embracing their own traditions and martial doctrines. All dynasties also benefit from the nigh-supernatural technologies that once saw them dominate the galaxy, perhaps the most unsettling of which are their reanimation protocols. Should a Necron be slain, its body becomes wreathed in an eerie glow. Crawling limbs reattach, sundered torsos and smashed skulls reform and the Necron rises again, shambling back into battle.

At the end of your Command phase, each unit from your army activates its Reanimation Protocols and reanimates D3 wounds. Each time such a unit reanimates a wound:

- If that unit contains one or more models with fewer than their starting number of wounds remaining, select one of those models; that model regains one lost wound.
- If all models in that unit have their starting number of wounds, but that unit is not at its Starting Strength, one destroyed model is returned to that unit with one wound remaining.

Once such a unit is at its Starting Strength and all of its models have their starting number of wounds, nothing further happens.

Example: A unit of Skorpekh Destroyers (which have a Wounds characteristic of 3) activates Reanimation Protocols. The unit had a Starting Strength of 3, but currently contains 2 models, and one of those models has lost 1 wound. A 3 is rolled to see how many wounds are reanimated. The first of these reanimated wounds restores the wounded Skorpekh Destroyer back to 3 wounds. The second of these reanimated wounds returns the destroyed Skorpekh Destroyer to the battlefield with 1 wound remaining. The third of these reanimated wounds restores one of the remaining lost wounds to the same Skorpekh Destroyer that was just returned. The unit now contains 3 models, two of which have 3 wounds remaining and one of which has 2 wounds remaining.

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# PROTOCOL OF RESONANT FOCUS

The Overlord seethes with an anger millions of years old. When they turn their hateful gaze upon those they consider lesser vermin, their disgust resonates through multiple spectra, driving their warriors to focus the wrath upon their master’s chosen foe.

In your Command phase, select one enemy unit within 12" of and visible to the bearer. Until the end of the turn, each time a friendly Necrons model makes an attack that targets that enemy unit, re-roll a Hit roll of 1.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

You will use the Reclaim and Dominate secondary objective. You can replace this with the Treasures of Aeons.

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# RECLAIM AND DOMINATE

This territory is infested by the contemptible vermin of the lesser species. The Necrons’ rightful realm must resound to the march of metallic steps as its true masters reclaim what is theirs.

At the end of your turn, you score 4VP if one or more Necrons units from your army (excluding Battle-shocked units) are wholly within your opponent’s deployment zone.

# STRATAGEMS

You can use the following Stratagems:

# MERCURIAL RESILIENCE

The living metal that forms Necrons’ mechanical bodies is a supernatural material of strange properties. With sudden surges of energy, it resists the most powerful of enemy attacks.

|WHEN|Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.|
|---|---|
|COST|1CP|
|TARGET|One Necrons unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.|
|EFFECT|Until the end of the phase, models in your unit have a 5+ invulnerable save.|

# DISRUPTION FIELDS

A thrumming aura of negative energy surrounds the metal talons and blades of the Necrons, warping and dissolving both armour and flesh.

|WHEN|Fight phase.|
|---|---|
|COST|1CP|
|TARGET|One Necrons unit from your army that has not been selected to fight this phase.|
|EFFECT|Until the end of the phase, add 1 to the Strength characteristic of melee weapons equipped by models in your unit.|

# WILL OF THE OVERLORD

Directing their immortal will through the Necron vessels under their command, the Overlord projects a dominating presence upon the battlefield.

|WHEN|Your Command phase.|
|---|---|
|COST|1CP|
|TARGET|One Necrons unit from your army.|
|EFFECT|Until the start of your next Command phase, add 1 to the Objective Control characteristic of models in your unit.|
|RESTRICTIONS|You can only use this Stratagem if an Overlord model from your army is on the battlefield.|

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# TREASURES OF AEONS

The foe have looted ancient Necron riches that do not belong to them. These must be reclaimed at all costs and the enemy purged from the ancient sites.

At the start of the first battle round, select one objective marker in No Man’s Land.

You score 3VP each time a Necrons model from your army destroys an enemy unit that started the phase within range of that objective marker or within range of the objective marker within your deployment zone (if there is one).# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

Overlords lead the Necron dynasties in battle. Amonhotekh’s android mind is tremendously swift, his body implacably resilient and his weapons eldritch, ancient and lethal. Yet it is his indomitable will that is perhaps his most fearsome asset, for with this he drives entire armies to war.

Necron Warriors attack in rank upon shambling rank. Individually little more than mindless automata, they are relentless and deadly when commanded en masse. The Warriors’ metallic bodies can self-repair from even the most hideous damage, while their unceasing volleys of fire butcher the foe with mechanical efficiency.

Skorpekh Destroyers favour overwhelming close-quarters violence to slaughter their victims. Though ungainly off the battlefield, in combat their tripod limbs allow them to pass through enemy lines in a madcap pirouette of slashing hyperphase blades, nigh on impossible to evade or parry.

Plasmacyte: Once per battle for each Plasmacyte this unit has, when this unit is selected to fight, you can use this ability. If you do, until the end of the phase, melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability. Designer’s Note: Place the relevant number of Plasmacyte tokens next to the unit, removing one each time this unit uses this ability.

Canoptek Scarabs attack in skimming swarms. They descend upon the enemy with high-pitched chitters before breaking down infantry and tanks alike into raw energy with their feeder mandibles. Often attacking as the first wave of a Necron assault, these mechanical insectoids spread fear and destruction.

Canoptek Doomstalkers stride with eerie grace. Whether prowling their masters’ armouries as tireless sentinels or providing mobile fire support to the Necron legions, the Doomstalkers annihilate all those who dare stand against them with searing salvoes from their doomsday blasters.
