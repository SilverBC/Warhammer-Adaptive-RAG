# COMMANDER CLOUDSPEAR (1 MODEL)

- This model is equipped with:

The Enforcer Commander is the most durable form of T’au battlesuit and is accompanied by two shield drones that further improve its survivability. Being a Vehicle, combat, which means that against 9aaaa it is still able to shoot while in less melee-focused armies it can hold onto midfield objectives and continue to pump shots into the enemy.

# PATHFINDER TEAM (10 MODELS)

- The Pathfinder Shas’ui model is equipped with:
- - pulse carbine
- pulse pistol
- close combat weapon
- grav-inhibitor drone

3 Pathfinder models are equipped with:
- - pulse pistol
- rail rifle
- close combat weapon

6 Pathfinder models are equipped with:

The Pathfinder Team is the force’s primary access to heavy weaponry in the form of rail rifles, capable of dealing with vehicles and monsters alike. Due to the weapon’s Heavy ability, the deployment of this unit is critical, as not having to move in the first couple of turns can really improve their efficacy. The Shas’ui is also equipped with a grav-inhibitor drone, which can be a fantastic tool for interfering with enemy mobility and keeping your force safe from charges.

As such, while keeping the Pathfinder Team as a single unit can provide extra protection for your valuable rail rifles, splitting it into two Patrol Squads can allow the bearers of those guns to stand still and fire while you move the Shas’ui forwards to a much more effective position on the battlefield.# Warhammer 40K - Breacher Team and Devilfish

# Gameplay Overview

The Breacher Team’s pulse blasters are very potent firearms for tackling enemy infantry units, including powerful targets like Terminator Squads. The Rampart of Fire Stratagem pairs well with this, doubling down on their capacity to put out some very lethal firepower. These weapons are short ranged, however, and Fire Warriors are quite fragile, so be sure to position them carefully to avoid enemy retribution. The Lives Before Territory Stratagem is an excellent tool for getting them out of unfortunate situations too.

The Devilfish is a very durable transport, able to keep the Breacher Team safe until you are ready to unleash their powerful weaponry on the foe. This gives you the agency to pick and choose which targets you hit with that unit and, once they have been delivered, the Devilfish’s high speed and long-ranged weaponry allow it to relocate to backfield objectives and hold onto them for the rest of the game.# Combat Patrol - Sudden Dawn Cadre

# COMBAT PATROL

# SUDDEN DAWN CADRE

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use the Sudden Dawn Cadre can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. This will include a Faction ability – For the Greater Good – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

# FOR THE GREATER GOOD

The Hunter Cadres battle for the betterment of the T’au Empire, not for personal gain or egotistic accomplishments. This burning commitment allows for prodigiously effective covering fire. Enemies are pinned in place by deadly bursts of pulse blasts or the infamous T’au markerlight is used to expose even well-fortified enemy positions, allowing other T’au warriors to enfilade the vulnerable enemies with murderous accuracy.

In your Shooting phase, units from your army can work in pairs to help each other target specific enemy units. When they do this, one unit is the Observer unit and the other is their Guided unit. The enemy they are targeting is called their Spotted unit.

Your Commander in Enforcer Battlesuit model has the Electro-static Flares Enhancement. You can replace this with Prototype Systems.

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# ELECTRO-STATIC FLARES (AURA)

This warrior’s battlesuit has been modified to launch salvoes of obfuscation flares that douse its surrounding area in electro-static interference. While the wargear of all friendly units has been hardened against such measures, that of the enemy has no such protection.

- While a friendly T’au Empire unit (excluding Devilfish units) is within 6" of the bearer, enemy units cannot use the Fire Overwatch Stratagem to fire at that unit and each time a ranged attack targets that unit, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
- The bearer has a 4+ invulnerable save.

Each time you select this unit to shoot, if it is not an Observer unit, it can use this ability. If it does, select one other friendly unit with this ability that is also eligible to shoot (excluding Battle-shocked and Observer units). Until the end of the phase, this unit is considered a Guided unit, and that friendly unit is considered an Observer unit. Then select one enemy unit that is visible to both your units to be their Spotted unit. Until the end of the phase:

- Each time a model in a Guided unit makes an attack that targets their Spotted unit, improve the Ballistic Skill characteristic of that attack by 1 and, if their Observer unit has the Markerlight keyword, that attack has the [IGNORES COVER] ability.
- Each time a model in a Guided unit makes an attack that does not target their Spotted unit, worsen the Ballistic Skill characteristic of that attack by 1.

Note: See the diagram on page 76.

# OR

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# PROTOTYPE SYSTEMS

Following the tenets of the Greater Good, T’au war leaders often volunteer to field test new prototype weapons and support systems. In this way they take any risk on themselves rather than force it upon their subordinates. They also benefit from the power of these new, bleeding-edge technologies upon the battlefield.

- Each time the bearer is selected to shoot, you can re-roll one Hit roll and you can re-roll one Wound roll when resolving those attacks.
- Each time you roll to determine the number of attacks made with the bearer’s airbursting fragmentation projector, you can re-roll the result.
- The bearer has a 4+ invulnerable save.# Warhammer 40K - Sudden Dawn Cadre


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

You will use the Surprise Attack secondary objective. You can replace this with Ethereal Edict.

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# SURPRISE ATTACK

Focusing on one facet of the Mont’ka strategic philosophy, this force seeks to swiftly claim vital locations and extract all valuable intelligence, resources or the like from them. Their ultimate goal is to deny these potentially vital assets to the foe.

# In the first and second battle rounds:

At the end of your turn, you score 4VP for each objective marker in No Man’s Land you control.

# In the third, fourth and fifth battle rounds:

At the end of your turn, you score 2VP for each objective marker in No Man’s Land you control.

# STRATAGEMS

You can use the following Stratagems:

# FIGHT BY THE CODE

# 1CP

The Code of Fire requires warriors to maximise their firepower at all times, laying down accurate volleys even while on the move.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

TARGET: One T’au Empire unit from your army.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your unit is eligible to shoot in a turn in which it Fell Back.

# RAMPART OF FIRE

# SUDDEN DAWN CADRE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

# 1CP

When pressing forward into enemy territory, warriors of the Fire caste should always be ready to raise a veritable wall of point-blank firepower to drive back onrushing foes.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

TARGET: One T’au Empire unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes an attack that targets an enemy unit within 10", improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

# OR

# LIVES BEFORE TERRITORY

# SUDDEN DAWN CADRE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# ETHEREAL EDICT

It is the explicit will of the Ethereals that a key asset amongst the enemy force must be eliminated during this Mont’ka strike. All other considerations are secondary, for the word of the Ethereals is absolute.

At the start of the first battle round, your opponent must select one unit from their army. At the end of the battle, you score 12VP if that unit is destroyed.

# 1CP

Even amidst the potential risks of launching a Mont’ka into the heartlands of the foe, T’au strategic doctrine still emphasises manoeuvring so as to preserve Fire caste lives wherever possible.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

TARGET: One T’au Empire Infantry or T’au Empire Battlesuit unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal move of up to D6" and, until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, it has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.

Pathfinder Teams wreak havoc behind enemy lines. Their firepower is formidable, especially when sniping with potent rail rifles, and their attendant grav-inhibitor drone can drive the enemy back with bludgeoning gravitic waves. Yet their deadliest ability is painting priority targets with massed markerlights for heavier T’au units to annihilate.

Where enemies must be driven from fortified positions or voidships boarded, there go the Fire Warriors of the Breacher Teams. Their pulse blasters are short ranged but lethal, and when coupled with the team’s tough armour, tactical discipline and specialist support drones, Breacher Teams become nigh-unstoppable at close quarters.
