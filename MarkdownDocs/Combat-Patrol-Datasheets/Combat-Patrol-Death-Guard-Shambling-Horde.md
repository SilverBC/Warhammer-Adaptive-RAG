# Combat Patrol: Death Guard

# COMBAT PATROL: DEATH GUARD

# THE SHAMBLING HORDE

Many are the repulsive gifts of Nurgle, Chaos God of disease and despair, but few are as foul as the malaise known as Walking Pox. Typhus – known often as Nurgle’s Herald, or simply the Traveller – is a vector for this appalling sickness. His warband of foetid Death Guard battle-brothers are accompanied at all times by a shambling swarm of Poxwalkers – victims of the Walking Pox whose bodies and minds have been twisted into repugnant parodies by the dubious blessings of Nurgle.

This Combat Patrol includes the units shown below.

# THE SHAMBLING HORDE

# ABILITIES

The datasheets required to use the Shambling Horde can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Nurgle’s Gift – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

# NURGLE’S GIFT (AURA)

The Death Guard are carriers of countless infections and contagions, each a gift from Nurgle. Whenever they march to war, they contaminate all around them, overwhelming their victims’ immune systems and undoing metallic bonds, alien psychic materials and all manner of other components, rendering even armoured vehicles vulnerable.

While an enemy unit is within Contagion Range of this unit, subtract 1 from the Toughness characteristic of models in that enemy unit. Contagion Range changes over the course of the battle, as shown below.

Your Typhus model is your Warlord and has the Walking Plague Enhancement. You can replace this with Miasmic Arrival.

# ENHANCEMENTS

# DEFAULT ENHANCEMENT

# WALKING PLAGUE

As the daemonic diseases of the Plague God infest the carasses of the war-slain dead, a foul green glow blossoms in glassy eyes and mutant horrors rise again to fight on with rictus, leering grins.

In your Command phase, select one friendly Poxwalker unit within Contagion Range of the bearer. Return up to D6 destroyed Poxwalker models to that unit.

# CONTAGION RANGE

|BATTLE ROUND|CONTAGION RANGE|
|---|---|
|1ST BATTLE ROUND|3"|
|2ND BATTLE ROUND|6"|
|3RD BATTLE ROUND ONWARDS|9"|

# OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT

# MIASMIC ARRIVAL

A buzzing storm of plague flies coalesces amidst a whirling mass of miasmal fumes. As the gruesome maelstrom bursts apart once more, the foot soldiers of the Death Guard are revealed, manifested amidst the foulness.

Models in the bearer’s unit have the Deep Strike ability.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems

# Secondary Objectives

# Default Secondary Objective

# Contaminate Ground

The revolting rituals of the Death Guard spread myriad contagions outwards from the tainted heart of the battlefield.

From the second battle round onwards, at the end of your turn, you score 3VP if one or more Death Guard units from your army (excluding Battle-shocked units) are within 3" of the centre of the battlefield.

# Optional Secondary Objective

# Spread the Blight

More than merely defeating their foes, the Death Guard seek to maximise the spread of infection and despair through their ranks. This is a goal best achieved up close, where tainted fluids and noxious fumes can do their gruesome work.

You score 2VP each time a Death Guard model from your army destroys an enemy unit that started the phase within Contagion Range of one or more units from your army.

# Stratagems

|Stratagem|Type|CP Cost|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Corrosive Effluents|The Shambling Horde – Battle Tactic Stratagem|1CP|The weapons of the Death Guard seep corrosive foulness and flesh-eating bacterial filth. WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase. TARGET: One Death Guard unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase. EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes an attack, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.|
|Harbingers of Despair|The Shambling Horde – Strategic Ploy Stratagem|1CP|The mutated foulness and horrifyingly diseased aspect of Nurgle’s worshippers is an assault upon soul and senses both, and more than one foe has despaired at the mere sight of such harbingers of inevitable entropy. WHEN: Start of the Fight phase. TARGET: One Death Guard unit from your army. EFFECT: Each enemy unit within Engagement Range of your unit must take a Battle-shock test.|
|Disgustingly Resilient|The Shambling Horde – Battle Tactic Stratagem|1CP|So bloated with diseased blubber are the Death Guard, so inured to pain and repugnantly mutated, that they can soak up truly shocking amounts of punishment without even the slightest hint of discomfort. WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets. TARGET: One Death Guard unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks. EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an attack is allocated to a model in your unit, subtract 1 from the Damage characteristic of that attack.|# Warhammer 40K Combat Patrol Datasheet

Host of the Destroyer Hive, for millennia Typhus has travelled the galaxy, spreading Nurgle’s Rot and killing billions. When he takes to the field, he slices apart countless foes with his filth-encrusted power scythe and unleashes the swarming horror of his Destroyer Hive to engulf them in murderous plague-flies.

Biologus Putrifiers take obscene delight in developing myriad plagues to spread in battle. They carry all manner of blight grenades, bloated with the latest strains of blossoming contagions. With their injector pistols, Biologus Putrifiers implant killing maladies into the enemy before extracting samples of their ruined flesh.

The mainstay of Death Guard vectoriums, Plague Marines excel in short-ranged firefights and relentless assaults that grind the enemy down. They are tactically astute, deploying plague spewers to drown hordes of enemies in noxious slime, and blight launchers to release crippling ironblight into armoured vehicles.

Poxwalkers are victims of the Walking Pox, a cruel virulence that rots the infected to death while keeping them conscious. They are terror troops, their ceaseless groaning a vector by which they infect the living. In battle they drown their foes in a sea of decaying flesh, clawing hands and gnashing teeth.
