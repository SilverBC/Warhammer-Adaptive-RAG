# Combat Patrol: Deathwatch

# Vigil Force Alphion

# Abilities

The datasheets required to use Vigil Force Alphion can be found on the following pages, and are designed exclusively for Combat Patrol games. A unit’s datasheet will list all the abilities it has. This will include a Faction ability – Oath of Moment – that is referenced on each unit’s datasheet, and is described below.

# Oath of Moment

In battle, Space Marines swear mighty oaths to destroy the enemies of the Emperor and uphold the honour of their Chapter, and such vows are sacrosanct. When the Angels of Death strike, they do so with the precision of a surgeon and the force of a thunderbolt. Experience and strategic expertise help them to read the shifting shape of the battle with post-human speed and clarity, directing their wrath towards one priority target after another. Command assets are annihilated, leaving the enemy reeling leaderless. Heavy armour, potent artillery and the vaunted elites of the foe’s forces are laid waste with horrifying speed, until the Emperor’s Angels of Death stand victorious over a field of smouldering wreckage and bolt-riddled corpses, and honour is finally satisfied.

Your Lieutenant model is your Warlord and has the Aegis Vigilate Enhancement. You can replace this with Aliens’ Bane.

# Default Enhancement

# AEGIS VIGILATE

This ancient adamantine mantle was fashioned by the venerated artificer Solomonius Derante, who was said to have made a century’s study of the offensive capabilities of every xenos species known to Humanity. Derante poured all his accumulated wisdom into his masterwork, secure in the knowledge that it would ward the warriors of the Deathwatch against the horrors of a dark and predatory galaxy.

- Add 1 to the Toughness characteristic of models in the bearer’s unit, and those models have a 4+ invulnerable save.

At the start of your Command phase, select one unit from your opponent’s army. Until the start of your next Command phase, that enemy unit is your Oath of Moment target. Each time a model with this ability makes an attack that targets your Oath of Moment target, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

# Optional Enhancement

# ALIENS’ BANE

Addros Garatine; Lutheo Voss; Remus Iolo; Variel the Unmerciful; these are but some of the storied champions of the Deathwatch who have borne this masterwork blade into battle against Xenos of every sort. Their righteous hatred is said to have suffused the sword such that its machine spirit now loathes the alien every bit as much as the warriors who wield it.

- The bearer’s melee weapons have the [PRECISION] ability and each time the bearer makes a melee attack, add 1 to the Wound roll.# Warhammer 40K - Secondary Objectives and Stratagems


# SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

# DEFAULT SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# HUNTERS’ INSIGHT

The warriors of the Deathwatch know that Humanity’s many foes are capable of innumerable unpleasant strategic surprises if allowed time and space by a lax foe. At the heart of their battlefield doctrine is the imperative to strike swiftly and decisively and to never permit their quarry to gain such an advantage.

At the start of each of your turns, select one objective marker that is not within your deployment zone. At the end of your opponent’s next turn, you score 4VP if you control that objective marker and there are one or more Adeptus Astartes units from your army within range of it (excluding Battle-shocked units).

# OPTIONAL SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

# HEAD-TAKER DOCTRINE

Against many alien factions, especially the more numerous and ill-disciplined, the most expedient strategy is to cut off the head and let the body die. This is a principle long developed by the Deathwatch into a veritable art form.

Each time an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army destroys an enemy Character model, you score 5VP.

At the end of the battle, if all enemy Character models are destroyed, you score 5VP.

# STRATAGEMS

# VETERAN INSTINCTS

# VIGIL FORCE ALPHION – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Every Deathwatch battle-brother is a storied veteran who can boast highly developed survival instincts and a surfeit of grit and determination.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, models in your unit have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability. If your unit has the Gravis keyword, models in your unit have the Feel No Pain 4+ ability instead.

Cost: 1CP

# SPECIAL-ISSUE AMMUNITION

# VIGIL FORCE ALPHION – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

From the mutagenic acids of hellfire rounds to armour-piercing kraken penetrator rounds or unstable but deadly vengeance rounds, the Deathwatch make use of a wide array of rare and specialised bolt shells to fight their alien prey.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase.

EFFECT: Select one of the following set of abilities. Until the end of the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in your unit have that set of abilities:

- [ANTI-MONSTER 5+, ANTI-VEHICLE 5+, MELTA 2]
- [ASSAULT, IGNORES COVER, SUSTAINED HITS 2]

Cost: 1CP

# DEATHWATCH TELEPORTARIUM

# VIGIL FORCE ALPHION – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The Deathwatch employ rare and specialist technologies in their never-ending war against xenos invaders. Many of their warships incorporate heavily warded and unusually accurate teleportarium shrines to drop kill teams directly into the heart of the foe’s position.

WHEN: End of your opponent’s Fight phase.

TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that is not within Engagement Range of any enemy units.

EFFECT: Remove your unit from the battlefield. In the Reinforcements step of your next Movement phase set your unit up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 3" horizontally from all enemy models.

RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this Stratagem once and after being set up on the battlefield, until the end of the turn, your unit is not eligible to declare a charge.
