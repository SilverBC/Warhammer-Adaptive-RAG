These documents collect amendments to the rules and present our responses to players’ frequently asked questions. Often these amendments are updates necessitated by new releases or community feedback. At other times, these amendments are errata designed to correct mistakes or add clarity to a rule that is not as clear as it might be. Where existing passages of rules text are presented, new or revised sections are marked in red. Entries marked with have been newly added or revised since the previous iteration of this document.

# UPDATES & ERRATA

Page 72 – Vanguard Onslaught, Neuronode Enhancement

Change to:

‘Tyranids model only. After both players have deployed their armies, you can select up to three Vanguard Invader units from your army and redeploy all of those units. When doing so, any of those units can be placed into Strategic Reserves, regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves.’

# FAQS

# Q: Does a unit affected by the Psychostatic Disruption Enhancement have to arrive from Reserves in the next Movement phase?

A: No.

# Q: Does the Synaptic Goading Stratagem allow a unit to leave Engagement Range and move towards the closest objective marker?

A: Yes.

# Q: Can units targeted by the Shadow in the Warp army rule use the Insane Bravery Stratagem?

A: No. Insane Bravery can only be used in your Command phase.

# Q: When using the Reclaim Biomass Stratagem, can the Stratagem effect be used on the unit that was just destroyed?

A: No.

# Q: Does an Attached unit containing a Hive Tyrant and Tyrant Guard receive the Stealth ability from a Venomthrope’s Foul Spores ability?

A: No. The unit has the Monster keyword and the ability excludes Monsters.

# Q: Are Spore Mines units that are added to an army during a battle restricted by abilities that prevent Reserves from being set up within a certain range (e.g. Space Marines Infiltrators’ Omniscrambers)?

A: No.

# Q: Do rules such as the Insurmountable Odds Detachment rule and the Carnifexes’ Blistering Assault ability let me choose between not moving the unit in question or moving the unit as far as possible following the conditions?

A: Yes.

# Q: If I roll one D6 for a Carnifexes unit’s Blistering Assault move and then choose not to move the models, do they still count as having made a Blistering Assault move that phase?

A: Yes, they have made a Blistering Assault move of 0".

# Q: When a Carnifex model makes a Blistering Assault move or an Endless Multitude model makes a Surge move, does that model have to move the full amount allowed by the dice result?

A: No, it can move any distance up to that allowed distance.
