These documents collect amendments to the rules and present our responses to players’ frequently asked questions. Often these amendments are updates necessitated by new releases or community feedback. At other times, these amendments are errata designed to correct mistakes or add clarity to a rule that is not as clear as it might be. Where existing passages of rules text are presented, new or revised sections are marked in red. Entries marked with ✦ have been newly added or revised since the previous iteration of this document.

# FAQS

# Q: When I select a unit as the target of the Fire Overwatch Stratagem, can that unit make a Dark Pact?

A: Yes, as the unit is selected to shoot.

# Q: When a model ‘fights on death’, can that model’s unit make a Dark Pact?
