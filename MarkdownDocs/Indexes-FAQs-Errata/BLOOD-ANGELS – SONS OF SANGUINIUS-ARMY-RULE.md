# BLOOD ANGELS – SONS OF SANGUINIUS

# DETACHMENT RULE

Gene-sons of the angel-winged Primarch Sanguinius, the Blood Angels descend into battle on flaming wings to stand between the Emperor’s servants and the heretical and alien hordes that seek to destroy them. Masters of the rapid assault, the mechanised offensive and the swift airborne strike, they have carved out a legacy of victories that stretches across the ages.

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can use this Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule.

# RESTRICTIONS

- Your army can include Blood Angels units, but it cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn from any other Chapter.

# THE RED THIRST

Though they strive to restrain it, the murderous ferocity of the Blood Angels simmers beneath the surface of their thoughts. In battle, this rage drives them towards the foe and lends great strength to their blows.

Each time an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army is selected to fight, if that unit made a Charge move this turn, until the end of the phase, add 2 to the Strength characteristic and add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of melee weapons equipped by models in that unit.

# BLOOD ANGELS – SONS OF SANGUINIUS

# STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule, you can use these Sons of Sanguinius Stratagems.

|Stratagem|Description|
|---|---|
|ANGEL’S SACRIFICE SONS OF SANGUINIUS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM|The Blood Angels would gladly put themselves in harm’s way to protect others, exemplifying the sacrifice of Sanguinius. 1CP WHEN: Any phase. TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes Character unit from your army that was just destroyed. You can use this Stratagem on that unit even though it was just destroyed. EFFECT: Until the end of the battle, each time a friendly Adeptus Astartes unit makes an attack that targets the enemy unit that just destroyed your Character unit, you can re-roll the Hit roll.|
|AGGRESSIVE ONSLAUGHT SONS OF SANGUINIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM|The Sons of Sanguinius constantly push towards new foes, the bloodlust singing in their veins unleashed in a controlled dynamism. 1CP WHEN: Fight phase. TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army, just before that unit Consolidates. EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes a Consolidation move, it can move up to 6" instead of up to 3", provided your unit ends that Consolidation move in Unit Coherency and within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.|
|ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT SONS OF SANGUINIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM|The belligerency of the Adeptus Astartes combined with their transhuman physiology makes them unyielding foes to face. 1CP WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets. TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks. EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, worsen the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.|
|RED RAMPAGE SONS OF SANGUINIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM|In times of great desperation, fury and ferocity can be a warrior’s strongest allies. 1CP WHEN: Fight phase. TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that has not been selected to fight this phase. EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, melee weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [LANCE] and [LETHAL HITS] abilities.|

If you are using the Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule, you can use these Sons of Sanguinius Stratagems.

|Stratagem|Type|CP Cost|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|ONLY IN DEATH DOES DUTY END|EPIC DEED STRATAGEM|2CP|Imminent death does not prevent a Space Marine from enacting his final justice upon the enemies of the Imperium. WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets. TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks. EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that model has not fought this phase, do not remove it from play. The destroyed model can fight after the attacking model’s unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.|
|RELENTLESS ASSAULT|STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM|1CP|The Blood Angels are loathe to resort to the defensive strategies favoured by other Chapters, and a tactical withdrawal is but a prelude to re-entering the fray. WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army Falls Back. TARGET: That Adeptus Astartes unit. EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit is eligible to declare a charge even though it Fell Back this phase.|

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Blood Angels – Sons of Sanguinius Enhancements

# BLOOD ANGELS – SONS OF SANGUINIUS

# ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule, you can use these Sons of Sanguinius Enhancements.

# ARTISAN OF WAR

This warrior is a true artist both on and off the battlefield. His talents are reflected in the exquisite workmanship of his wargear, for he insists upon personally crafting his weapons of war.

- Adeptus Astartes model only.
- Improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of the bearer’s weapons by 1, and the bearer has a Save characteristic of 2+.

# VISAGE OF DEATH

This exquisitely crafted mask is a thing of dark beauty to the Blood Angels, and a sign of impending doom to their enemies. The unchanging expression of the mask inspires fear and uncertainty even in confident enemies. They see no anger, pain or elation on the wearer’s face – clues as to the warrior’s state of mind in a duel.

- Adeptus Astartes model only.
- While an enemy unit (excluding Monsters and Vehicles) is within Engagement Range of the bearer’s unit, halve the Objective Control characteristic of models in that unit.

# ARCHANGEL’S SHARD

When Sanguinius battled Horus, his magnificent blade was tragically shattered against the Warmaster’s profane battle plate. The shards were gathered up and new swords forged to incorporate them, each one gifted to a different successor Chapter.

- Adeptus Astartes model only.
- The bearer’s melee weapons have the [ANTI-CHAOS 5+] and [LANCE] abilities.

# ICON OF THE ANGEL

Entrusted to one whose faith in the primogenitor is profound, the Icon of the Angel takes the form of a small shrine upon the bearer’s backpack. Through displaying it, this warrior reminds his brothers of the heretics who fled after laying low the Angel, exhorting them to let no enemy escape their grasp again.

- Adeptus Astartes model only.
- Each time an enemy unit (excluding Monsters and Vehicles) within Engagement Range of the bearer’s unit is selected to Fall Back, models in that enemy unit must take Desperate Escape tests as if their unit was Battle-shocked. When doing so, if that enemy unit is also Battle-shocked by other means, subtract 1 from each of those Desperate Escape tests.
