These documents collect amendments to the rules and present our responses to players’ frequently asked questions. Often these amendments are updates necessitated by new releases or community feedback. At other times, these amendments are errata designed to correct mistakes or add clarity to a rule that is not as clear as it might be. Where existing passages of rules text are presented, new or revised sections are marked in red. Entries marked with ✦ have been newly added or revised since the previous iteration of this document.

# UPDATES & ERRATA

# Page 70 – Skitarii Hunter Cohort, Veiled Hunter Enhancement

Change to:

‘Skitarii Marshal model only. After both players have deployed their armies, you can select up to three Skitarii Infantry units from your army and redeploy all of those units. When doing so, any of those units can be placed into Strategic Reserves, regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves.’

# Page 85 – Skitarii Marshal, Abilities, Servo-skull Uplink

Change to:

‘Once per battle, at the start of any phase, you can select one friendly Skitarii unit that is Battle-shocked and within 6" of this model. That unit is no longer Battle-shocked.’

# Page 98 – Skorpius Dunerider, Abilities, Core

Add ‘Firing Deck 2’.

# Page 99 – Onager Dunecrawler, Abilities

Add the following ability:

‘Scuttling Walker: Each time this model makes a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move, it can move through friendly Monster and Vehicle models and sections of terrain features that are 4" or less in height.’
