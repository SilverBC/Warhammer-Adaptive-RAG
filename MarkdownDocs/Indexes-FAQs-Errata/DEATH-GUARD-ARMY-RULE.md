# Death Guard

# Army Rule

The Death Guard are carriers of countless infections and contagions, each a gift from Nurgle. Whenever they march to war, they contaminate all around them, overwhelming their victims’ immune systems and undoing metallic bonds, alien psychic materials and all manner of other components, rendering even armoured vehicles vulnerable.

# Nurgle’s Gift (Aura)

If your Army Faction is Death Guard, while an enemy unit is within Contagion Range of this unit, subtract 1 from the Toughness characteristic of models in that enemy unit. Contagion Range changes over the course of the battle, as shown below.

# DEATH GUARD – PLAGUE COMPANY

# DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Death Guard, you can use this Plague Company Detachment rule.

# SPREAD THE SICKNESS

To the Death Guard, spreading Nurgle’s gifts goes beyond the beings they fight – even the landscapes they tread upon they seek to corrupt, cultivating Nurgle’s garden as widely as possible.

During the Declare Battle Formations step, select one of the Sicknesses below. Until the end of the battle, all units from your army with the Nurgle’s Gift ability gain the selected Sickness.

- Skullsquirm Blight (Aura): While an enemy unit is within Contagion Range of this unit, worsen the Ballistic Skill and Weapon Skill characteristics of weapons equipped by models in that enemy unit by 1.
- Rattlejoint Ague (Aura): While an enemy unit is within Contagion Range of this unit, worsen the Save characteristic of models in that enemy unit by 1.
- Scabrous Soulrot (Aura): While an enemy unit is within Contagion Range of this unit, worsen the Leadership and Objective Control characteristics of models in that enemy unit by 1 (to a minimum of 1).

If you control an objective marker at the end of your Command phase and a Death Guard unit from your army is within range of that objective marker, that objective marker is said to be Infected and remains under your control even if you have no models within range of it, until your opponent controls it at the start or end of any turn. In addition, while an objective marker is Infected and under your control, it has the Nurgle’s Gift ability as if it were a unit from your army (so enemy units within Contagion Range of it will have their characteristics modified).# Warhammer 40K - Death Guard Plague Company Stratagems

# DEATH GUARD – PLAGUE COMPANY

# STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Plague Company Detachment rule, you can use these Plague Company Stratagems.

# DEATH GUARD – PLAGUE COMPANY

# ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Plague Company Detachment rule, you can use these Plague Company Enhancements.

# LIVING PLAGUE

Saturated as he is with Nurgle’s contagious blessings, merely to stand before this warlord is to be assailed by an oppressive aura of plague.

# THE DRONING (AURA)

This warrior is surrounded by a cloud of dreaded plague flies that harass the Death Guard’s enemies and feed on their sanity.

- Death Guard model only. While an enemy unit is within Contagion Range of the bearer, each time that unit fails a Battle-shock test, roll one D6: on a 2-5, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound; on a 6, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

# SHAMBLEROT

The strains of the zombie virus carried by the Death Guard slowly but surely break mortals around them, sapping their strength and dexterity before consuming them utterly.

- Death Guard model only. Each time the bearer’s unit is selected as a target of an enemy unit’s charge, until the end of the phase, subtract 2 from Charge rolls made for that enemy unit.

Many of Nurgle’s gifts take the form of metaphysical maladies, parasitic infestations or physical mutations. Some become so overburdened by them that they suddenly and horrifically change in a rupture of bulged armour and skin. All that is left of them is a Chaos Spawn, a crazed monstrosity that lives only to kill and feed.
