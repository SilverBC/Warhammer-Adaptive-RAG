These documents collect amendments to the rules and present our responses to players’ frequently asked questions. Often these amendments are updates necessitated by new releases or community feedback. At other times, these amendments are errata designed to correct mistakes or add clarity to a rule that is not as clear as it might be. New or revised text is presented in red, with a text highlight applied to revisions made previously (excluding passages that were added or replaced in full).

# Updates & Errata

# Page 94, Hybrid Metamorphs, Abilities, Brood Surge

Change to:

‘If, at the start of the battle, no model in this unit is equipped with a hand flamer, each time this unit makes a Brood Surge move, it can be moved up to 6" instead of up to D6". A unit cannot make a Brood Surge move while it is Battle-shocked.’

# Page 69 – Cult Ambush Army Rule, first paragraph

Change to:

‘If your Army Faction is Genestealer Cults, each time a unit with this ability is destroyed, roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if it is the first or second battle round. On a 5+, add a new unit to your army identical to your destroyed unit, in Cult Ambush, at its Starting Strength, with all of its wounds remaining and any [ONE SHOT] weapons those models are equipped with considered as not having been shot. Then place one Cult Ambush marker* anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy units (if this is not possible, no marker is placed). You can set up that unit on the battlefield using a Cult Ambush marker as described below or, if it has the Deep Strike ability, in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up that unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy units.’
