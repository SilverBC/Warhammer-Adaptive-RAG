# Leagues of Votann - Warhammer 40K

# LEAGUES OF VOTANN

# ARMY RULE

The Kin are a highly practical people in every area of life, not least in war. Their leaders make swift and careful
calculations before and during battle, constantly striving to determine if the potential reward of conflict is worth
the inevitable loss of resources and precious Kin lives. An essential part of this is what is known as casting the
Eye of the Ancestors, through which Kin commanders assess the greatest enemy threats, mark weak points in
their defences and determine what forces are needed to overcome both.

# EYE OF THE ANCESTORS

If your Army Faction is Leagues of Votann, each time an enemy unit destroys a Leagues of Votann unit from your army, that enemy unit gains 1 Judgement token. An enemy unit can never have more than 2 Judgement tokens (any further Judgement tokens a unit would gain beyond this are ignored).

Each time a model from your army with this ability makes an attack that targets a unit that has one or more Judgement tokens, until that model’s attacks have been resolved, apply the relevant bonus from the table below to that attack.

# JUDGEMENT TOKENS

|Judgement Tokens|Bonus|
|---|---|
|1|Eminent Threat: Add 1 to the Hit roll.|
|2|Add 1 to the Hit roll and add 1 to the Wound roll.|

Designer’s Note: If a unit with Judgement tokens is removed from the battlefield, make a note of how many Judgement tokens it had when it was removed. If that unit is set up on the battlefield again, place the corresponding number of Judgement tokens next to it. If a unit with Judgement tokens splits up into two or more smaller units, each of those units gains a number of Judgement tokens equal to that of the original unit. If two units combine to form a single larger unit and either of those units had Judgement tokens, make a note of how many the unit with the most has, just before they combine – the new unit has a number of Judgement tokens equal to this.

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Warhammer 40K - Leagues of Votann Oathband Detachment Rule

# LEAGUES OF VOTANN – OATHBAND

# DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Leagues of Votann, you can use this Oathband Detachment rule.

# RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY

The Kin of an Oathband are skilled warriors and ruthless expansionists, instinctively working together to defeat their foes and efficiently achieve their aims. As with everything, they approach war with a grim, methodical pragmatism that is an inspiration to other Kin.

At the start of the battle, select a number of units from your opponent’s army depending on the battle size, as shown below:

- Incursion: 2 units
- Strike Force: 4 units
- Onslaught: 6 units

Each of those units start the battle with 2 Judgement tokens (see Eye of the Ancestors).

If, at the start of any of your Command phases, any of those units have been destroyed, you gain a number of CP depending on how early in the battle you destroyed it, as shown on the right (you can only gain CP in this way once per battle, and CP gained in this way are an exemption to the Core Rules that limit the maximum number of CP you can gain per battle round to 1).

|Unit destroyed by the start of your|CP Gained|
|---|---|
|first or second Command phase:|3CP|
|third or fourth Command phase:|2CP|
|fifth Command phase:|1CP|

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Leagues of Votann – Oathband Stratagems

# LEAGUES OF VOTANN – OATHBAND

# STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Oathband Detachment rule, you can use these Oathband Stratagems.

# WARRIOR PRIDE

# OATHBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The warriors of the Leagues of Votann pride themselves on their martial skill and proficiency in combat, and when the Ancestors are watching their actions they can quickly overwhelm and pick apart their foes.

WHEN: Fight phase.

TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit from your army, and one enemy unit that has one or more Judgement tokens and is within Engagement Range of that Leagues of Votann unit.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes a melee attack that targets that enemy unit, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1 for each Judgement token that enemy unit has.

# ANCESTRAL SENTENCE

# OATHBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

Some foes are so loathed that the Ancestors themselves are said to pass sentence upon them, marking them for death.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit from your army.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes a ranged attack, that attack has the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability, and each time a model in your unit makes a ranged attack that targets a unit that has one or more Judgement tokens, that attack has the [SUSTAINED HITS 2] ability instead.

# REACTIVE REPRISAL

# OATHBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

2CP

Once an enemy target has been marked out by the Eye of the Ancestors, the Kin focus their efforts upon its destruction, redoubling their fury should it attempt to engage.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit that has one or more Judgement tokens has resolved its attacks.

TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.

EFFECT: Your Leagues of Votann unit can shoot as if it were your Shooting phase, but it must target the enemy unit that just attacked it, and can only do so if that enemy unit is an eligible target.

# STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Oathband Detachment rule, you can use these Oathband Stratagems.

# NEWFOUND NEMESIS

# OATHBAND – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

To strike down Kin is to earn the immediate and murderous ire of all their warrior comrades.

|WHEN|Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has resolved its attacks.|
|---|---|
|TARGET|One Leagues of Votann Infantry or Leagues of Votann Mounted unit from your army that was reduced to Below Half-strength as a result of the attacking unit’s attacks.|
|EFFECT|The attacking unit gains 1 Judgement token, or up to 2 Judgement tokens instead if that Leagues of Votann unit contained your Warlord when it was targeted by those attacks.|
|COST|1CP|

# VOID ARMOUR

# OATHBAND – WARGEAR STRATAGEM

Void armour comprises hardened, jointed segments hooked into the void suit beneath. It is fashioned from magnaferrite weave, and often reinforced with adamantine and enhanced with microfield generators.

|WHEN|Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.|
|---|---|
|TARGET|One Leagues of Votann unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.|
|EFFECT|Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your Leagues of Votann unit, worsen the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.|
|COST|1CP|

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Leagues of Votann – Oathband Enhancements

# LEAGUES OF VOTANN – OATHBAND ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Oathband Detachment rule, you can use these Oathband Enhancements.

# APPRAISING GLARE

Few Kin can cast the Eye of the Ancestors with the swiftness and grim efficiency of this venerable leader. Where their merciless gaze falls, the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy are laid bare, and there their warriors strike hardest.

# GRIM DEMEANOUR

This warlord’s grim countenance is legendary, and they are rumoured to have never smiled. Such a demeanour is, of course, an outward sign of how seriously they undertake their solemn tasks, and under their stern gaze no Kin will be found wanting.

Leagues of Votann model only. In your Command phase, you can select one objective marker your opponent controls. Until the start of your next Command phase, while an enemy unit is within range of that objective marker, it counts as having one more Judgement token than it actually has (to a maximum of 2).

# A LONG LIST

This warrior holds the majority of the galaxy’s races in contempt, and seeks out their many nemeses with a keen and inescapable eye. No sooner have they settled a Grudge against one foe, than they move to the next name on their list.

Leagues of Votann model only. Each time the bearer’s unit destroys an enemy unit, if that enemy unit has one or more Judgement tokens, you can select one other enemy unit that is visible to the bearer. That other unit gains one Judgement token.

# WAYFARER’S GRACE

This one-of-a-kind void suit was crafted for the famed Hernkyn adventurer Sîmmka Farstryd as thanks for her saving the Hold world of Hyvôk’s Kindred. Incorporating ancient technological secrets interpreted from Votannic lore, Wayfarer’s Grace acts as a life-support system for its wearer. Monitoring their vital statistics constantly, the suit provides medical support and can even restart its wearer’s stopped heart in extremis.

Leagues of Votann model only. The first time the bearer is destroyed, after placing a Judgement token next to the unit that destroyed it, roll one D6 at the end of the phase. On a 2+, set the bearer back up on the battlefield as close as possible to where it was destroyed and not within Engagement Range of any enemy units, with its full wounds remaining.

# Cthonian Beserks

Cthonian Beserks are amongst the most heavily augmented and courageous Kin. Brandishing mining-tools-cum-weapons-of-war and unleashing explosives that tunnel through solid rock, the Beserks storm the enemy’s strongpoints and break them open like an asteroid filled with seams of precious ore.

# Wargear Options

- All models in this unit can each have their heavy plasma axe replaced with 1 concussion maul.
- For every 5 models in this unit, 1 model that is not equipped with a mole grenade launcher can have its heavy plasma axe or concussion maul replaced with 1 twin concussion gauntlet.
- For every 5 models in this unit, 1 model that is not equipped with a twin concussion gauntlet can be equipped with 1 mole grenade launcher. If a model is equipped with a mole grenade launcher, add 1 to its Wounds and Attacks characteristics.*
- * Designer’s Note: If a Cthonian Beserk is equipped with a mole grenade launcher, it will be accompanied by an L-COG unit: both models should be placed on the same base and together they act as a single model for all rules purposes (albeit one with improved characteristics).

# Unit Composition

- 5-10 Cthonian Beserks

Every model is equipped with: heavy plasma axe.
