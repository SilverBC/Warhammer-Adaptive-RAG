# Warhammer 40K - Chaos Daemons Army Rules

# CHAOS DAEMONS

# ARMY RULES

When daemons pour into realspace, maelstroms of warp energy spill through in their wake. Manifest emotion and unbridled, nightmarish forces twist all that they touch, reshaping the landscape into bizarre forms while tormenting mortal beings to madness. To be embroiled in such tempests is to endure conditions utterly anathema to the fundamental laws of reality, provoking primal terror in even the most emotionless warriors.

# THE SHADOW OF CHAOS

If your Army Faction is Legiones Daemonica, certain areas of the battlefield are considered to be within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, as follows:

- Your deployment zone is always within your army’s Shadow of Chaos.
- At the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers within No Man’s Land, until the end of that phase, No Man’s Land is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos.
- At the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers within your opponent’s deployment zone, until the end of that phase, your opponent’s deployment zone is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos.

# DAEMONIC MANIFESTATION

While a Legiones Daemonica unit from your army is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, each time that unit takes a Battle-shock test, add 1 to that test and, if that test is passed, one model in that unit regains up to D3 lost wounds (if that unit is a Battleline unit and that test is passed, up to D3 destroyed models can be returned to that unit instead).

# DAEMONIC TERROR

While an enemy unit is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos and/or it is within 6" of one or more Bloodthirster, Great Unclean One, Kairos Fateweaver, Keeper of Secrets, Lord of Change, Rotigus, Shalaxi Helbane or Skarbrand units from your army, each time that unit takes a Battle-shock test, subtract 1 from that test and, if that test is failed, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

# CHAOS DAEMONS

# ARMY RULES

# DAEMONIC PACT

When the mortal servants of the Dark Gods march to war, the most favoured may find daemonic entities accompanying them.

If every model from your army has the Chaos keyword, you can include Legiones Daemonica units in your army, even if they do not have the Faction keyword you selected in the Select Army Faction step. The combined points cost of such units you can include depends on your battle size, as shown below.

|Battle Size|Points Limit|
|---|---|
|Incursion|Up to 250 pts|
|Strike Force|Up to 500 pts|
|Onslaught|Up to 750 pts|

None of these models can be your Warlord, and they cannot be given Enhancements. In addition:

- If your Army Faction is World Eaters, you can only include Khorne Legiones Daemonica units using these rules.
- If your Army Faction is Thousand Sons, you can only include Tzeentch Legiones Daemonica units using these rules.
- If your Army Faction is Death Guard, you can only include Nurgle Legiones Daemonica units using these rules.
- If your Warlord is Lucius the Eternal, you can only include Slaanesh Legiones Daemonica units using these rules.

In addition, for each of the following keywords, the number of non-Battleline units with that keyword you include in this way cannot be greater than the number of Battleline units with that keyword you include in this way:

- Khorne
- Tzeentch
- Nurgle
- Slaanesh

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Warhammer 40K - Chaos Daemons: Daemonic Incursion

# CHAOS DAEMONS – DAEMONIC INCURSION

# DETACHMENT RULES

If your Army Faction is Legiones Daemonica, you can use this Daemonic Incursion Detachment rule.

# WARP RIFTS

Daemonic legions tear through the fabric of realspace, malevolent entities flickering into being like phantasms from a nightmare. Worse still, as terror and panic take hold of their victims, so their mortal souls become ever easier prey for the entities pouring through from the warp.

Each time a Legiones Daemonica unit from your army is set up on the battlefield using the Deep Strike ability, if it is set up wholly within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, and/or if it is set up wholly within 6" of one or more friendly Bloodthirster, Great Unclean One, Kairos Fateweaver, Keeper of Secrets, Lord of Change, Rotigus, Shalaxi Helbane or Skarbrand units, with which it shares the Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh keyword, it can be set up anywhere that is more than 6" horizontally away from all enemy models, instead of more than 9".

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Warhammer 40K - Chaos Daemons: Daemonic Incursion Stratagems

# CHAOS DAEMONS – DAEMONIC INCURSION

# STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Daemonic Incursion Detachment rule, you can use these Daemonic Incursion Stratagems.

# CORRUPT REALSPACE

# DAEMONIC INCURSION – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Daemons instinctively feel the need to despoil and corrupt every corner of realspace, the better to sustain their otherworldly forms.

- WHEN: Start of any Command phase.
- TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit from your army that is within range of an objective marker you control.
- EFFECT: That objective marker is said to be Corrupted and remains under your control, even if you have no models within range of it, until your opponent controls it at the start or end of any turn. In addition, while an objective marker is Corrupted and under your control, the area of the battlefield within 6" of that objective marker is considered to be within your army’s Shadow of Chaos.

# DRAUGHT OF TERROR

# DAEMONIC INCURSION – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The swelling fear of their mortal prey serves as an intoxicating elixir to the daemonic followers, each draught invigorating their forms with deadly power.

- WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase.
- TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of weapons equipped by models in that unit by 1. In addition, until the end of the phase, each time such a weapon targets a unit that is Battle-shocked, you can re-roll the Wound roll.

# WARP SURGE

# DAEMONIC INCURSION – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

The winds of the warp blow strong, invigorating daemonkind and lending them supernatural speed and ferocity.

- WHEN: Your Charge phase.
- TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit from your army that is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your unit is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which it Advanced.

# DENIZENS OF THE WARP

# DAEMONIC INCURSION – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Ever lurking in the warp, daemons will wait until the barriers between realms thin before tearing their way into realspace.

- WHEN: Your Movement phase.
- TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit from your army that is arriving using the Deep Strike ability this phase.
- EFFECT: Your unit can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 3" horizontally away from all enemy models.
- RESTRICTIONS: A unit targeted by this Stratagem is not eligible to declare a charge in the same turn.

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Warhammer 40K - Chaos Daemons: Daemonic Incursion Stratagems

# CHAOS DAEMONS – DAEMONIC INCURSION

# STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Daemonic Incursion Detachment rule, you can use these Daemonic Incursion Stratagems.

# THE REALM OF CHAOS

# DAEMONIC INCURSION – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

When the energies of the warp bleed into realspace, the Legiones Daemonica can rip open portals in seeming thin-air, returning to their hellscapes only to rematerialise amidst their foes a heartbeat later.

- Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: End of your opponent’s turn.
- TARGET: Up to two Legiones Daemonica units from your army that are within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, or one other Legiones Daemonica unit from your army.
- EFFECT: Remove the targeted units from the battlefield and place them into Strategic Reserves. They will arrive back on the battlefield in the Reinforcements step of your next Movement phase using the Deep Strike ability.
- RESTRICTIONS: You cannot target units that are within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units with this Stratagem.

# DAEMONIC INVULNERABILITY

# DAEMONIC INCURSION – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Daemons are madness given form. Their very bodies are fashioned from the stuff of the warp, and are difficult to destroy through conventional means.

- Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.
- TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of that enemy unit’s attacks.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an invulnerable saving throw is made for a model in your unit, re-roll a saving throw of 1.

# Shadow of Khorne (Aura)

The area of the battlefield within 6" of this Fortification is considered to be within your army’s Shadow of Chaos. In addition, while a friendly Khorne Legiones Daemonica unit is within 6" of this Fortification, each time you take a Battle-shock test for that unit, you can re-roll that test.

# Cover

Each time a ranged attack is allocated to a model, if that model is not fully visible to every model in the attacking unit because of this Fortification, that model has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.

# Fortification

While an enemy unit is only within Engagement Range of one or more Fortifications from your army:

- That unit can still be selected as the target of ranged attacks, but each time such an attack is made, unless it is made with a Pistol, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
- Models in that unit do not need to take Desperate Escape tests due to Falling Back while Battle-shocked, except for those that will move over enemy models when doing so.
