# Aeldari Army Rule

The Aeldari live on the brink of extinction. As such, their Farseers have become adept at reading future events, seeing the many strands of fate ahead of their people and the consequences of following each one. Taken at the right time, a simple action can avoid calamitous outcomes, aiding the Aeldari in their continued struggle for survival.

# Strands of Fate

If your Army Faction is Aeldari, at the start of the battle, make a Strands of Fate roll by rolling six D6.

If you wish, you can then re-roll all of these dice, but if you do, roll one less D6. You can continue re-rolling all of the dice in this manner, rolling one less D6 each time you do, until you are satisfied with the results rolled (or until you only have a single D6 remaining).

When you are satisfied with the results rolled, those remaining dice become your Fate dice for the battle. These results cannot be changed or re-rolled further, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Fate dice to one side – this is your Fate dice pool.

Once per phase, before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army with the Strands of Fate ability, if you have one or more dice in your Fate dice pool, you can use one of those Fate dice. To do so, select one of those Fate dice to substitute that dice roll. The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Fate dice is used as if it had been rolled (this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Fate dice can only be used in this way once. After using a Fate dice, remove it from your Fate dice pool and roll all remaining dice that are part of that dice roll (if any).

You can use Fate dice for any of the following types of dice roll:

- Advance roll
- Battle-shock test
- Charge roll
- Damage roll
- Hit roll
- Saving throw
- Wound roll

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Warhammer 40K - Aeldari Battle Host

# AELDARI – BATTLE HOST

# DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Aeldari, you can use this Battle Host Detachment rule.

# UNPARALLELED FORESIGHT

When the Aeldari take to the battlefield, any who oppose them are left confounded by their grace, elegance and martial skill. Where lesser beings would falter, the Aeldari move with a surety of purpose that can only be perceived as preordained.

Each time an Aeldari unit from your army is selected to shoot or fight, you can re-roll one Hit roll and you can re-roll one Wound roll when resolving those attacks.

# CORSAIRS AND TRAVELLING PLAYERS

The Dark City is frequented by ruthless mercenaries and nomadic warriors from other strands of the ancient race. Troupes of Harlequins and piratical bands of Corsairs accompany many Drukhari raids, free from constrictive paths to pursue profits and fated agendas across the galaxy.

If your Army Faction is Drukhari, you can include Harlequins and Anhrathe units in your army, even though they do not have the Drukhari Faction keyword. The combined points value of Harlequins and/or Anhrathe units you can include in your army depends on the battle size, as follows:

- Incursion: Up to 250 pts
- Strike Force: Up to 500 pts
- Onslaught: Up to 750 pts

No Harlequins or Anhrathe models included in your army in this way can be your Warlord, and they cannot be given Enhancements.

# YNNARI

Yvraine is a divider as much as a unifier amongst the Aeldari race, drawing both hatred and admiration. To some once-allies she and her ideals have become an immovable rift, yet between some once-enemies her influence has sewn bonds of fellowship once thought impossible.

If your Army Faction is Aeldari and your Warlord is Yvraine, you can include Drukhari units in your army, even though they do not have the Aeldari Faction keyword. The combined points value of such units you can include in your army depends on the battle size, as follows:

- Incursion: Up to 500 pts
- Strike Force: Up to 1000 pts
- Onslaught: Up to 1500 pts

No Drukhari models included in your army in this way can be given Enhancements. You cannot include units with any of the following keywords in your army using these rules:

- Phoenix Lords
- Avatar of Khaine
- Solitaire
- Haemonculus Covens

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Aeldari – Battle Host Enhancements

# AELDARI – BATTLE HOST

# ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Battle Host Detachment rule, you can use these Battle Host Enhancements.

# THE PHOENIX GEM

At the height of the War in Heaven, Isha drew down the heat of a hundred stars into a glittering gem to save Asuryan. It is said that the Phoenix Gem is the only surviving fragment of this ancient stone, and still retains the power to return life to the fallen.

- Aeldari model only. The first time the bearer is destroyed, roll one D6: on a 2+, keep it to one side. At the end of the phase, set the bearer back up again, as close as possible to its previous position and not within Engagement Range of any enemy models, with its full wounds remaining.

# THE WEEPING STONES

Carved from psychoactive rubies, these runic stones resemble the beads of blood that drip from the hand of Khaine. In battle, these stones rearrange themselves, revealing elements of the future.

# READER OF THE RUNES

Using their prescience to discern the enemy commander’s intentions, this psyker can react before the foe’s plans even come into action.

- Aeldari Psyker model only. In your Command phase, you can select one dice in your Fate dice pool, re-roll it, then add it back to your Fate dice pool displaying the result you just rolled.

# FATE’S MESSENGER

The strands of fate coil and twist around this warrior, the paths of destiny manipulated to keep them from harm so that they might strike back at their foes.

- Aeldari model only. Once per turn, just after making a Hit roll, a Wound roll or a saving throw for the bearer, you can treat the result as an unmodified roll of 6 instead.
- Aeldari model only. Each time the bearer’s unit destroys an enemy unit, roll one D6 and add it to your Fate dice pool displaying the result you just rolled.

# AELDARI – BATTLE HOST

# STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Battle Host Detachment rule, you can use these Battle Host Stratagems.

# FEIGNED RETREAT

# BATTLE HOST – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The Aeldari are forever elusive, and their actions are unpredictable and deceptive. What appears to be a full retreat one moment is revealed as the prelude to a devastating attack the next.

- CP Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after an Aeldari unit from your army makes a Fall Back move.
- TARGET: That Aeldari unit.
- EFFECT: Your unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge this turn even though it Fell Back.

# MATCHLESS AGILITY

# BATTLE HOST – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Grace in battle and merciless efficiency are prized virtues in craftworld armies. Like the shimmering blades of Khaine, the Asuryani carve through the ranks of their enemies.

- CP Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: Your Movement phase.
- TARGET: One Aeldari unit from your army that has not been selected to move this phase.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, if your unit Advances, do not make an Advance roll for it. Instead, until the end of the phase, add 6" to the Move characteristic of models in your unit.

# FIRE AND FADE

# BATTLE HOST – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The Aeldari are masters of hit-and-run tactics, engaging a target with a flurry of shots before quickly manoeuvring into cover or out of sight.

- CP Cost: 2CP
- WHEN: End of your Shooting phase.
- TARGET: One Aeldari unit from your army.
- EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal move. It cannot embark within a Transport at the end of this move.
- RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select an Aircraft unit or a unit within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units, and until the end of the turn, the unit you selected is not eligible to declare a charge.

# BLADESTORM

# BATTLE HOST – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The well-trained Aeldari are able to lay down a hail of fire from their weapons, their superior reflexes allowing them to track even the most sudden movement and place every shot perfectly.

- CP Cost: 1CP
- WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
- TARGET: One Aeldari unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes an attack, on a Critical Wound, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 2.

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Aeldari – Battle Host Stratagems

# AELDARI – BATTLE HOST

# STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Battle Host Detachment rule, you can use these Battle Host Stratagems.

# PHANTASM

# BATTLE HOST – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

The Aeldari are masters of misdirection, and they employ holo-emitters and psychic phantasms to fool enemy scouts.

- WHEN: End of your opponent’s Movement phase.
- TARGET: One Aeldari Infantry unit from your army (excluding Aircraft).
- EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal move of up to D6". It cannot embark within a Transport at the end of this move.
- RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select a unit within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units, and until the end of the turn, you cannot target that unit with the Heroic Intervention Stratagem.

# LIGHTNING-FAST REACTIONS

# BATTLE HOST – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The Aeldari can process battlefield events at baffling speed, making their physical reactions so fast that they are able to dodge attacks that would hit any other target.

- WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.
- TARGET: One Aeldari unit from your army (excluding Wraith Construct units) that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.

- Arcane Cover: Each time a ranged attack is allocated to a model, if that model is not fully visible to every model in the attacking unit because of this Fortification, that model has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.
- Webway Strike: Each time a friendly Aeldari unit arrives from Strategic Reserves, you can choose to set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is wholly within 6" of this Fortification. If you do, that Aeldari unit can be set up within 9" of enemy models, and can be set up within Engagement Range of enemy models. If an Aeldari unit is set up within Engagement Range of any enemy models in this way, it counts as having made a Charge move this turn and is eligible to fight this turn.
- Fortification: While an enemy unit is only within Engagement Range of one or more Fortifications from your army:
- That unit can still be selected as the target of ranged attacks, but each time such an attack is made, unless it is made with a Pistol, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
- Models in that unit do not need to take Desperate Escape tests due to Falling Back while Battle-shocked, except for those that will move over enemy models when doing so.
