# CHAOS KNIGHTS

# ARMY RULES

Where Chaos Knights tread, the skies grow unnaturally dark and the dread of the warp permeates the battlefield. None are immune to its shadowy touch, for those it does not paralyse with fear and despair are wracked with hallucinations and driven mad.

# HARBINGERS OF DREAD

If your Army Faction is Chaos Knights, each model from your army with this ability gains a bonus depending on which Dread abilities are active for your army (see below). Once a Dread ability is active for your army, that ability applies until the end of the battle.

# BATTLE ROUND 1 ONWARDS

From the first battle round onwards, the Despair ability is active for your army:

# DESPAIR (AURA)

While an enemy unit is within 12" of this model, each time that enemy unit takes a Battle-shock or Leadership test, subtract 1 from that test.

# BATTLE ROUND 3 ONWARDS

From the third battle round onwards, the Doom and Darkness ability is active for your army:

# DOOM AND DARKNESS

- Each time this model makes an attack, if the target is Battle-shocked, add 1 to the Wound roll.
- Each time an attack targets this model, if the attacking model’s unit is Battle-shocked, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.

# DREADBLADES

Dreadblades often wander the galaxy, carving a path of destruction and slaughtering foes alongside other forces of Chaos as and when they will.

If every model in your army has the Chaos keyword, you can include either 1 Titanic Chaos Knights model or up to 3 War Dog models in your army, even if they do not have the Faction keyword you selected in the Select Army Faction step. None of these models can be your Warlord, and they cannot be given Enhancements.

# SUPER-HEAVY WALKER

Each time a model with this ability makes a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move, it can move through models (excluding Titanic models) and sections of terrain features that are 4" or less in height. When doing so:

- It can move within Engagement Range of enemy models, but cannot end that move within Engagement Range of them.
- It can also move through sections of terrain features that are more than 4" in height, but if it does, after it has moved, roll one D6: on a 1, that model is Battle-shocked.# Warhammer 40K - Chaos Knights – Traitoris Lance

# CHAOS KNIGHTS – TRAITORIS LANCE

# DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Chaos Knights, you can use this Traitoris Lance Detachment rule.

# FORGED IN TERROR (AURA)

Chaos Knights are servants of shadow and terror; wherever they stride, fear and madness spread.

In the Battle-shock step of your opponent’s Command phase, if an enemy unit that is below its Starting Strength is within 12" of a Chaos Knights model from your army, that enemy unit must take a Battle-shock test. For the purposes of this ability, if a unit has a Starting Strength of 1, it is considered to be below its Starting Strength while it has lost one or more wounds.

Designer’s Note: This means that all enemy units within range of this Aura ability that have lost one or more models must take a Battle-shock test in your opponent’s Command phase, not just those that are Below Half-strength.

# CHAOS KNIGHTS – TRAITORIS LANCE

# ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Traitoris Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Traitoris Lance Enhancements.

# LORD OF DREAD

This tyrannical Knight is the epitome of dread power, instilling as much fear in their minions as they do over the enemy, ensuring unwavering obedience.

- Chaos Knights model only. At the start of the Fight phase, you can select one enemy unit within Engagement Range of the bearer; that enemy unit must take a Battle-shock test.

# AURA OF TERROR

This towering Knight is wreathed in tendrils of warp energy that caress the minds of any enemy who draws near, driving those touched into a state of abject fear. Wherever this Knight treads, this aura of terror permeates and corrupts the land until it can be cleansed.

- Chaos Knights model only. If you control an objective marker at the end of your Command phase, and the bearer is within range of that objective marker, that objective marker is said to be Tainted and remains under your control even if you have no models within range of it, until your opponent controls it at the start or end of any turn.
- In addition, while an objective marker is Tainted and under your control and the Despair Dread ability is active for your army, that objective marker has the Despair Dread ability as if it was a Chaos Knights model from your army (so subtract 1 from Battle-shock and Leadership tests taken for enemy units within 12" of it).

# THE TRAITOR’S MARK

The dark deeds and bloodstained heraldry of this Chaos Knight are whispered far and wide. Rumours spread that to confront it is to face a painful death. Each blazon borne upon its hull proclaims the unholy atrocities committed by the bearer, and even to look upon these loathsome sigils is to be gripped by unnatural terror and beset by swarming nightmares.

- Chaos Knights model only. The Doom and Darkness ability is active for the bearer from the first battle round onwards, instead of from the third.

# PANOPLY OF THE CURSED KNIGHTS

Borne within an unmarked casket by an order of silent Idolators, this collection of tattered pennants, chain-strung charms and armour scraps represent the last remains of the Knight Carnivus Grymm. It is said that festooning one’s Knight suit with these charms instils the legendary fortitude of that doomed war engine. Yet it is whispered that doing so also invites the attentions of the same dread curse that eventually led to Carnivus Grymm’s ghastly end.

- Chaos Knights model only. Each time an attack is made against the bearer, subtract 1 from the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack.

If you are using the Traitoris Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Traitoris Lance Stratagems.

# A LONG LEASH
