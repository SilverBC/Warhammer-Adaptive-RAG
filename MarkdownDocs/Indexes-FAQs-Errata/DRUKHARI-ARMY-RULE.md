# Drukhari Army Rules - Warhammer 40K

# DRUKHARI

# ARMY RULE

The Drukhari are experts in precise torture, sharp blades, cruel poisons and eldritch abominations. Using the labyrinthine network of webway spars, they strike almost anywhere. Realspace raiding parties prey upon worlds across the galaxy, surging from hidden portals unknown to those they see merely as cattle or playthings. As the Drukhari feed on the souls of the slain, they become imbued with supernatural might, eventually turning into killing machines.

# POWER FROM PAIN

If your Army Faction is Drukhari, units from your army with this ability can become Empowered Through Pain. This is done using Pain tokens.

# GAINING PAIN TOKENS

If your Army Faction is Drukhari, you gain Pain tokens as follows:

- At the start of the battle, depending on the battle size:
- COMBAT PATROL - 1 PAIN TOKEN
- INCURSION - 2 PAIN TOKENS
- STRIKE FORCE - 3 PAIN TOKENS
- ONSLAUGHT - 4 PAIN TOKENS
- Each time an enemy unit is destroyed, you gain 1 Pain token.
- Each time an enemy unit fails a Battle-shock test, you gain 1 Pain token.

Each time you gain a Pain token, keep it to one side – this is your Pain token pool.

# EMPOWERED THROUGH PAIN

At the start of any phase, you can expend one or more Pain tokens from your Pain token pool. Each time you do, select one unit from your army with the Power from Pain ability. Until the end of the phase, that unit is Empowered, and gains the abilities listed below, depending on the phase.

OR

- Empowered in the Movement or Charge phase:
- You can re-roll Advance or Charge rolls made for that unit.
- Empowered in the Shooting or Fight phase:
- Each time a model in that unit makes an attack, you can re-roll the Hit roll and, if it is a melee attack, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Warhammer 40K - Drukhari Realspace Raiders

# DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS

# DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Drukhari, you can use this Realspace Raiders Detachment rule.

# REALSPACE RAIDERS

The three factions of the Drukhari are constantly vying for supremacy, each convinced beyond doubt of their own innate superiority. This struggle manifests during their realspace raids as a frenzy of murderously sadistic competition.

At the start of the battle, you gain an additional 1 Pain token for each of the following your army contains:

- One or more Archon models
- One or more Succubus models
- One or more Haemonculus models

Designer’s Note: These are all cumulative, so if your army contains at least one Archon, at least one Succubus and at least one Haemonculus, you would start the battle with an additional 3 Pain tokens.

# DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS

# ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Realspace Raiders Detachment rule, you can use these Realspace Raiders Enhancements.

# CRUCIBLE OF MALEDICTION

When opened, the souls of tortured psykers spew outward, driving any nearby warp-wielders insane.

- Type: Haemonculus model only.
- Effect: Once per battle, at the start of any Shooting phase, the bearer can use this Enhancement. When it does, every enemy unit within 12" must take a Battle-shock test, subtracting 1 from that test if the bearer’s unit is currently Empowered. Each time a Psyker unit fails this test, it suffers D3 mortal wounds.

# LABYRINTHINE CUNNING

This Archon has a mind like steel traps, assimilating every detail of a situation.

- Type: Archon model only.
- Effect: Each time you select the bearer’s unit as the target of a Stratagem, roll one D6, adding 3 to the result if the Stratagem being used is Alliance of Agony: on a 4+, you gain 1CP.

# BLOOD DANCER

This Succubus is renowned for their expertise at close-quarters combat within the arenas of Commorragh. The skills they display before the baying crowds on the blood-soaked sands are equally deadly on the battlefield.

- Type: Succubus model only.
- Effect: Improve the Attacks and Armour Penetration characteristics of the bearer’s melee weapons by 1. While the bearer is Empowered, improve the Attacks and Armour Penetration characteristics of the bearer’s melee weapons by 2 instead.

# THE ART OF PAIN

Some Drukhari elevate their battle plans to another level by creating a spectacle of torment that maims and cripples every foe in order to draw out the moment of the kill, heightening the pleasure they derive before the fatal blow falls.

- Type: Drukhari model only.
- Effect: In your Command phase, if the bearer is on the battlefield, you gain 1 Pain token.

# DRUKHARI – SKYSPLINTER ASSAULT

# DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Drukhari, you can use this Skysplinter Assault Detachment rule.

# RAIN OF CRUELTY

Few warriors in the galaxy are as adept at launching punishing skyborne raids as the Drukhari. Before their prey even realise the peril, the killers of Commorragh are amongst their lines like grinning ghouls. Splinter fire lays low defenders still scrambling into position. Quicksilver assaults leave dozens screaming in maimed agony. Often, the battle is over before it has even truly begun.

Each time a Drukhari unit from your army disembarks from a Transport, until the end of the turn, that unit’s ranged weapons have the [IGNORES COVER] ability and that unit’s melee weapons have the [LANCE] ability.

# ENHANCEMENTS

# PHANTASMAL SMOKE

Phantasm grenade launchers, elegantly worked into the curved hull plates of their Raiders, discharge in covering patterns. Hallucinogenic vapours conceal the advancing Drukhari and confuse their foes’ aim.

- Drukhari model only. While the bearer’s unit is wholly within 6" of a friendly Drukhari Transport, models in the bearer’s unit have the Benefit of Cover and the Stealth ability.

# SPITEFUL RAIDER

This cruel realspace raider knows the best reason to take something from the foe is for the simple spite of denying them that which they most desire to keep.

- Drukhari model only. Each time the bearer’s unit destroys an enemy unit in the Fight phase, if that enemy unit was within range of one or more objective markers when the bearer’s unit was selected to fight, you gain 1 additional Pain token.

# SADISTIC FULCRUM

Witnessing this murderous warrior wreaking havoc, the sadistic crew of the Drukhari anti-grav transports are filled with the vigour only the suffering of others can provide.

# NIGHTMARE SHROUD

This strange Drukhari artefact wreathes its bearer and their allies in a cloying cloud of unnatural shadow. Flitting into battle under cover of this pall, they are nigh impossible for the prey to see coming.

- Drukhari model only. Each time you expend a Pain token to Empower the bearer’s unit in the Shooting phase, you can select one friendly Drukhari Transport within 3" of the bearer’s unit; until the end of the phase, that Transport is also Empowered.
- Drukhari model only. Each time the bearer’s unit disembarks from a Transport, until the end of the turn, enemy units cannot use the Fire Overwatch Stratagem to shoot at the bearer’s unit.

# VICIOUS BLADES

SKYSPLINTER ASSAULT – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Wielding a horrifying array of hooked boarding blades, barbed lariats and other specialised tools of agony, these warriors hack and slash at their foes even as their transport skims low overhead.

1CP

WHEN: Fight phase, just after a Drukhari Transport from your army has selected its targets.

TARGET: That Transport.

EFFECT: After your Transport has fought, select one enemy unit that was the target of one or more of those attacks and roll one D6 for each model embarked within your Transport, adding 1 to the result if that embarked model is a Wracks model: for each 5+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound (to a maximum of 6 mortal wounds).

# POUNCE ON THE PREY

SKYSPLINTER ASSAULT – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Incredible alien agility and a delight in taking wild risks help these warriors to leap acrobatically from their skimming transports directly into battle.

1CP

WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after a Drukhari Infantry unit from your army disembarks from a Transport that made a Normal move this phase.

TARGET: That Infantry unit.

EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit is eligible to declare a charge.

# SKYBORNE ANNIHILATION

SKYSPLINTER ASSAULT – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

These warriors are well versed in raining suppressing fire on the foe even as they close with them from on high, shredding defences and leaving the survivors easy prey for the raid.

1CP

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

TARGET: One Drukhari unit from your army that disembarked from a Transport this turn and has not been selected to shoot this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability, or the [SUSTAINED HITS 2] ability instead if it is a Kabalite Warriors unit.

# WRAITHLIKE RETREAT

SKYSPLINTER ASSAULT – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Employing smoke grenades, paralysing mists or simple cunning and agility, these warriors slip away like spectres.

1CP

WHEN: End of the Fight phase.

TARGET: One Drukhari Infantry unit from your army that fought this phase.

EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal or Fall Back move, but unless it is a Wyches unit, it must end that move wholly within 3" horizontally and 5" vertically of a friendly Drukhari Transport and must embark within that Transport at the end of that move.

# VENOM

Raw speed delivers countless light Venom transports to the heart of the enemy’s defence, and sees them chase down stragglers and encircle the foe’s outriders. For the clique of warriors on board, Venoms are mobile firebases and gore-splashed chariots in one, with flickering shields that confound attempts to bring them down.

# WARGEAR OPTIONS

- This model’s twin splinter rifle can be replaced with 1 splinter cannon.

# UNIT COMPOSITION

- 1 Venom

This model is equipped with: splinter cannon; twin splinter rifle; bladevanes.

# TRANSPORT

This model has a transport capacity of 6 Drukhari Infantry models. This model cannot transport Grotesque models or models that can Fly.

Before the battle, at the start of the Declare Battle Formations step, you can select one Kabalite Warriors or Wyches unit from your army. If you do, that unit is split into two units, each containing as equal a number of models as possible (when splitting a unit in this way, make a note of which models form each of the two new units). One of these units must start the battle embarked within this Transport; the other can start the battle embarked within another Transport, or it can be deployed as a separate unit.

# Voidraven Bomber

Mounting some of the most powerful guns in the Drukhari arsenal, the Voidraven Bomber’s dark scythes and void lances can crack heavily armoured targets. Yet they pale against the silent aircraft’s primary weapon – the void mine. Once this arcane payload is deployed, the resulting darklight implosion erases all caught within its blast.
