These documents collect amendments to the rules and present our responses to playersâ€™ frequently asked questions. Often these amendments are updates necessitated by new releases or community feedback. At other times, these amendments are errata designed to correct mistakes or add clarity to a rule that is not as clear as it might be. Where existing passages of rules text are presented, new or revised sections are marked in red. Entries marked with ðŸ”¹ have been newly added or revised since the previous iteration of this document.

# FAQS

Q: When using Lion Elâ€™Jonsonâ€™s All Secrets Revealed ability, if my opponent targets a unit with a Stratagem and subsequently fails the Battle-shock test triggered by this ability, do they reduce their CP total despite the Stratagemâ€™s effects not being resolved (but still counting as having been used)?

A: Yes.
