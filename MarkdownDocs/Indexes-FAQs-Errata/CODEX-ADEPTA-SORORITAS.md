These documents collect amendments to the rules and present our responses to players’ frequently asked questions. Often these amendments are updates necessitated by new releases or community feedback. At other times, these amendments are errata designed to correct mistakes or add clarity to a rule that is not as clear as it might be. New or revised text is presented in red, with a text highlight applied to revisions made previously (excluding passages that were added or replaced in full).

# FAQS

# Q: Can a Miracle dice be used as part of a re-roll?

A: Yes.

# Q: If I re-roll a roll in which I substituted a dice with a Miracle dice, do I get to use the Miracle dice in that re-roll (e.g. when re-rolling a Charge roll)?

A: No, that Miracle dice is lost. Note that your unit has still performed an Act of Faith.

# Q: Can the Triumph of Saint Katherine’s Simulacrum of the Ebon Chalice Relics of the Matriarchs ability be used to substitute two dice in a single roll?

A: No.

# Q: In the Adepta Sororitas army rule Acts of Faith, you gain 1 Miracle dice ‘each time an Adepta Sororitas unit from your army is destroyed’. Does this happen when the unit is destroyed or at the end of the phase?

A: When the unit is destroyed.
