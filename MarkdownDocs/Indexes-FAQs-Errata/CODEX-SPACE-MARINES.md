# FAQS

# Q: While an Attached unit is embarked within a Transport, do weapons that Transport shoots with using the Firing Deck ability benefit from any abilities the attached Leader has (e.g. a Lieutenant’s Tactical Precision ability, which grants weapons in its unit the [LETHAL HITS] ability)?

A: No. Firing Deck enables a Transport to be equipped with a number of weapons equipped by its passengers (Core Rules, page 17), but the Transport itself is not part of that Attached unit, and embarked units cannot use abilities unless otherwise stated.

# Q: When an Attached unit is selected as an Oath of Moment target, if that unit ceases to be an Attached unit, does the effect persist on the remaining unit?

A: Yes. See Persisting Effects in the Core Rules Errata.

# Q: Can a unit embarked within a Transport be selected as the Oath of Moment target?

A: No. See the Embark section on page 17 of the Core Rules.

# Q: Can a unit in Reserves be selected as the Oath of Moment target?

A: Yes.

# Q: Can a unit in Reserves use an Enhancement (following all restrictions outlined by that Enhancement)?

A: Yes.

# Q: If I have two or more Impulsors within 6" of a unit I target with a Stratagem, do each of their Orbital Comms Array wargear abilities trigger?

A: No, they are Aura abilities and so do not stack.

# Q: If I use a Stratagem on a unit within 6" of an Impulsor with an Orbital Comms Array, but I do not roll high enough to gain 1CP as a result of that wargear, if that same unit is within 6" of a different Impulsor that also has an Orbital Comms Array, can I attempt to roll another D6 to try to gain 1CP?

A: No.

# Q: Do multiple instances of the Astartes Banner ability stack?

A: Yes.

# Rules and FAQs

# Q&A Section

Q: If I select one Monster or Vehicle unit as the target of all of a Stormspeeder Thunderstrike’s ranged weapons, and the first weapon that model makes attacks with scores one or more hits, do I add 1 to the Wound rolls made for attacks with its remaining weapons?
A: No. Only after you have resolved the attacks with all weapons it is shooting with this phase, has that model shot (see ‘Shot’ in the Rules Commentary).

Q: If the mission rules I am using state that Reserves units cannot arrive on the battlefield during the first battle round (e.g. the Pariah Nexus mission pack), can I target my Drop Pod with the Rapid Ingress Stratagem during the first battle round if I have the second turn?
A: No.

Q: Can I set up a unit that has the Hunter’s Instincts Enhancement from Strategic Reserves during the first battle round?
A: Yes. Additionally, you can set up such a unit within your opponent’s deployment zone during the second battle round.

Q: Can I target a unit that has the Hunter’s Instincts Enhancement with the Rapid Ingress Stratagem during the first battle round?
A: Yes.

Q: When making attacks with a unit from my army, I split my attacks between the first Oath of Moment target selected as part of my army rule and the second Oath of Moment target selected using Roboute Guilliman’s Master of Battle Author of the Codex ability. If I destroy the first Oath of Moment target before resolving my attacks against the second Oath of Moment target, will those attacks against the second Oath of Moment target benefit from the re-rolls to hit?
A: No. Only after all of the attacks from that unit have been resolved will the second Oath of Moment selection become active.
