# Warhammer 40K - Emperor's Children Army Rules

# EMPEROR’S CHILDREN

# ARMY RULES

# THE CHOSEN OF SLAANESH

The Emperor’s Children attack in a riotous clash of excruciating aural assaults,
eye-watering chromatic dissonance and ostentatious precision.

When mustering your army, you can select Emperor’s Children as your Army
Faction. If you do:

- Your army must include Lucius the Eternal, and that model must be your Warlord.
- Lucius the Eternal and Noise Marines units from your army gain the Heretic Astartes Faction keyword.
- You can include Heretic Astartes units in your army (excluding Khorne, Nurgle and Tzeentch units), even though they do not have the Emperor’s Children Faction keyword.
- For the purposes of the Dark Pacts ability (see right), your Army Faction is still considered to be Heretic Astartes.
- In the Select Detachment Rules step, you can select a Detachment from Codex: Chaos Space Marines. If you select the Pactbound Zealots Detachment, each time you select a keyword for a Heretic Astartes unit to gain as a result of the Marks of Chaos rule, you must select Slaanesh.
- Each time you select a keyword for a Daemon Prince or Daemon Prince with Wings model to gain as a result of the Daemonic Allegiance rule, you must select Slaanesh.

# DARK PACTS

Beseeching the Chaos Gods with fanatical fervour, the profane champions of the
Heretic Astartes pray for diabolic boons, promising the vilest of offerings in return
for their power.

This ability is described in full on the Army Rules page of

Armour of Shrieking Souls: Each time this model is destroyed by an attack made by an enemy unit, that unit must take a Leadership test: if that test is passed, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds; if that test is failed, that enemy unit suffers D6 mortal wounds. If mortal wounds inflicted in this way destroy that enemy unit, set this model back up on the battlefield, as close as possible to where it was destroyed and not within Engagement Range of any enemy models, with D3 wounds remaining.|

# LUCIUS THE ETERNAL

An arrogant slaughterer and swordsman supreme, Lucius seeks out the most skilled of the foe’s champions, casually striking down lesser enemies that dare bar his path. Against worthy opponents, Lucius strikes with the speed of a snake, his daemonically sentient lash and duellist’s sword making a mockery of the greatest warriors.

# Noise Marines

Orchestrating riotous destruction on vast scales, Noise Marines saturate the war zone with explosive bolts, clashing aural waves and extreme psychosonic attacks. These hedonistic worshippers of Slaanesh are inured to most stimuli, and seek to unleash the most cacophonous destruction to stir their jaded senses.
