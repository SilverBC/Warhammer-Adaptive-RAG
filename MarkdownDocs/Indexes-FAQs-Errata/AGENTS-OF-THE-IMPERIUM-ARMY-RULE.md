# AGENTS OF THE IMPERIUM

# ARMY RULE

Throughout the Imperium there exist numerous martial organisations and shadowy institutions. Bodies of armed warriors or solitary agents from these groups possess specialist skills, unusual equipment and vested interests that lead them to be attached to larger Imperial armies. Some are requisitioned by the army’s commander for their particular abilities, others are assigned by their hidden masters to achieve singular agendas. The most powerful have the authority and reputation to enforce their presence on the field of battle.

# ASSIGNED AGENTS

If every model from your army has the Imperium keyword, you can include Agents of the Imperium units in your army even if they do not have the Faction keyword you selected in the Select Army Faction step. If every model from your army has the Agents of the Imperium Faction keyword, you can ignore the Select Detachment Rules step when mustering your army. The maximum number of Agents of the Imperium units you can include in your army depends on the battle size, as shown below.

|BATTLE SIZE|Maximum number of Agents of the Imperium units|
|---|---|
|INCURSION|Retinue units: 1 Character units: 1|
|STRIKE FORCE|Retinue units: 2 Character units: 2|
|ONSLAUGHT|Retinue units: 3 Character units: 3|

In addition, you cannot select a Vindicare Assassin, Culexus Assassin, Eversor Assassin or Callidus Assassin to be your Warlord.
