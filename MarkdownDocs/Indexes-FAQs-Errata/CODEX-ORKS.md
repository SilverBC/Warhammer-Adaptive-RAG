These documents collect amendments to the rules and present our responses to players’ frequently asked questions. Often these amendments are updates necessitated by new releases or community feedback. At other times, these amendments are errata designed to correct mistakes or add clarity to a rule that is not as clear as it might be. Where existing passages of rules text are presented, new or revised sections are marked in red. Entries marked with have been newly added or revised since the previous iteration of this document.

# FAQS

Q: If a model has an ability that triggers when you call a Waaagh! and that model is embarked within a Transport when this happens (e.g. a Warboss’ Da Biggest and da Best ability), does that ability take effect?

A: No. Abilities do not take effect while units are embarked within Transports unless they explicitly state otherwise.
