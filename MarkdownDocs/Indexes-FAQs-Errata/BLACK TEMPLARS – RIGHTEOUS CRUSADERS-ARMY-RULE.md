# BLACK TEMPLARS – RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS

# DETACHMENT RULE

The Black Templars are the most zealous of all the Space Marine Chapters. To them, the Emperor is a literal deity, and there is no oath they will not swear, no vow they will not take or bloody act of battlefield worship they will not perform in his name.

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can use this Righteous Crusaders Detachment rule.

# RESTRICTIONS

- Your army cannot include any Adeptus Astartes Psyker models, and cannot include any of the following models that do not have the Black Templars keyword:
- Gladiator Lancer
- Gladiator Reaper
- Gladiator Valiant
- Impulsor
- Repulsor
- Repulsor Executioner
- Your army can include Black Templars units, but it cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn from any other Chapter.

# TEMPLAR VOWS

On the eve of battle, the warriors of a Black Templars crusade gather together to be led in prayer and contemplation by their Chaplains. In their righteous zeal, united in their hatred of the foe, they swear a mighty vow to uphold in the battle ahead.

At the start of the first battle round, select one of the four Templar Vows below to be active for Adeptus Astartes units from your army until the end of the battle.

- Suffer Not the Unclean to Live: Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.
- Uphold the Honour of the Emperor: Models in this unit have the Feel No Pain 6+ ability and a Leadership characteristic of 5+.
- Abhor the Witch, Destroy the Witch: Models in this unit have a 4+ invulnerable save against Psychic Attacks and melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [ANTI-PSYKER 4+] ability.
- Accept Any Challenge, No Matter the Odds: Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

# STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Righteous Crusaders Detachment rule, you can use these Righteous Crusaders Stratagems.

|Stratagem|Type|CP Cost|When|Target|Effect|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|FERVENT ACCLAMATION|RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM|1CP|Your Command phase.|One Adeptus Astartes Character unit from your army.|Select one Templar Vow that is not active for your army. Until the start of your next Command phase, while that Character is leading a unit, models in that unit gain the benefits of that vow in addition to the vow selected to be active for your army at the start of the battle.|
|DEVOUT PUSH|RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM|1CP|Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has shot.|One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that had one or more of its models destroyed as a result of the attacking unit’s attacks.|Your unit can make a Normal move of up to D6", but it must end that move closer to the enemy unit that just shot. If the Abhor the Witch, Destroy the Witch vow is active for your army, your unit can make a Normal move of up to 6" instead, but it must end that move either closer to the enemy unit that just shot, or closer to the closest enemy Psyker unit.|
|NO ESCAPE|RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM|1CP|Your opponent’s Movement phase, when an enemy unit (excluding Vehicles and Monsters) is selected to Fall Back.|One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that is within Engagement Range of that enemy unit.|Roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if the Accept Any Challenge, No Matter the Odds vow is active for your army. On a 4+, that enemy unit cannot Fall Back this phase and must Remain Stationary. Otherwise, that enemy unit can Fall Back this phase, but if it does, all models in that unit must take a Desperate Escape test.|

|VICIOUS RIPOSTE|1CP|Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.|One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.|Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if the Uphold the Honour of the Emperor vow is active for your army.

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Warhammer 40K - Black Templars Enhancements

# BLACK TEMPLARS – RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS

# ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Righteous Crusaders Detachment rule, you can use these Righteous Crusaders Enhancements.

# PERDITION’S EDGE

With blades carved from noctilith, these axes separate the victim’s soul from the warp briefly as the death blow is delivered. What is only a moment in reality feels like an eternity of damnation to the departing spirit – punishment for their sins against the immortal Emperor.

Adeptus Astartes model only.

- Improve the Strength and Armour Penetration characteristics of the bearer’s melee weapons by 1.
- If the Suffer Not the Unclean to Live vow is active for your army, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of the bearer’s melee weapons as well.

# WITCHSEEKER BOLTS

With casings forged from the blades of fallen battle-brothers and blessed by the devout priests of the Ministorum, these bolt rounds have an unerring habit of finding their way to the heart of the witch.

Adeptus Astartes model only.

- The bearer’s ranged weapons have the [PRECISION], [ANTI-PSYKER 4+] and [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] abilities.
- If the Abhor the Witch, Destroy the Witch vow is active for your army, each time the bearer makes a ranged attack that targets a Psyker unit, you can re-roll the Hit roll and you can re-roll the Wound roll.

# TÄNNHAUSER’S BONES

Marshal Tännhauser was martyred at the hands of the Black Legion at the decisive battle of the Rutger’s Reach Crusade. His bones, encased in small reliquaries, were distributed amongst the warriors of that crusade during the victory sermon. Each is a potent reminder of duty and the expectations placed upon every Black Templar.

Adeptus Astartes model only.

- Each time an attack is allocated to the bearer, halve the Damage characteristic of that attack.
- While the bearer is leading a unit, if the Uphold the Honour of the Emperor vow is active for your army, models in that unit have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability.
