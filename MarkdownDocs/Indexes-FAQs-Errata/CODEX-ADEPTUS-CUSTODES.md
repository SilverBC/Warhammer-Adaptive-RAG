These documents collect amendments to the rules and present our responses to players’ frequently asked questions. Often these amendments are updates necessitated by new releases or community feedback. At other times, these amendments are errata designed to correct mistakes or add clarity to a rule that is not as clear as it might be. Where existing passages of rules text are presented, new or revised sections are marked in red. Entries marked with new have been newly added or revised since the previous iteration of this document.

# UPDATES & ERRATA

# Page 70 – Talons of the Emperor, Champion of the Imperium Enhancement

Change to read:

‘Adeptus Custodes model only. The range of the bearer’s Null Aegis or Deadly Unity ability (see left) is increased to 9".’

# Page 72 – Shield Host, Castellan’s Mark Enhancement

Change to read:

‘Shield‑Captain model only. After both players have deployed their armies, you can select up to two Adeptus Custodes units from your army (excluding Anathema Psykana units) and redeploy all of those units. When doing so, any of those units can be placed into Strategic Reserves, regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves.’

# Page 77 – Auric Champions, Shoulder the Mantle Stratagem

Change to read:

‘WHEN: Your Movement phase, before the Reinforcements step.

TARGET: One Adeptus Custodes Character model from your army that is not leading a unit.

EFFECT: Select one friendly unit (excluding Battle-shocked and Attached units) within 2" horizontally and 5" vertically of your model that it could lead (as described in the Leader section of its datasheet). Your model attaches to that unit as a Leader. Change that unit’s Starting Strength accordingly.’

# Page 85 – Valerian, Abilities, Core

Change to read:

‘Deep Strike, Feel No Pain 6+, Leader.’
