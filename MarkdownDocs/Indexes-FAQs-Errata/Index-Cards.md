# Q: If the mission rules I am using state that Reserves units cannot arrive on the battlefield during the first battle round (e.g. the Pariah Nexus mission pack), can I target a unit that has the First to the Fray Enhancement with the Rapid Ingress Stratagem during the first battle round if I have the second turn?

A: No.

# Squires’ Duty Stratagem – Effect section

Change to: ‘EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, when resolving attacks that target that enemy unit, improve the Strength and Armour Penetration characteristics of weapons equipped by those Armiger models by 1.

# Q: Do you score the Assassination Secondary Mission twice when you destroy Canis Rex then Sir Hekhtur?

A: Yes.

# Q: Do you score the Bring It Down Secondary Mission when you destroy Canis Rex?

# Q: For the purposes of completing the Deed of the Lay Low the Tyrant Oath, if the enemy Warlord is destroyed then resurrected, is the Deed still completed?

A: The completion of Deeds is determined at the start of your Command phase. If the enemy Warlord is not destroyed at the start of your Command phase, then even if you previously destroyed it, the Deed has not yet been completed. Once completed, however, that Deed remains completed (and so your army remains Honoured) even if that Warlord is no longer destroyed later in the battle.

A: Yes, but no further Servitor units can join that unit.

# Q: Does the Appraising Glare Enhancement give one Judgement token to each affected enemy unit that does not already have any Judgement tokens?

A: No, but while a unit is affected by Appraising Glare, add one to the number of Judgement tokens it has for the purposes of other rules. For the purposes of the A Long List Enhancement, for example, a unit that otherwise has no Judgement tokens would be considered to have one Judgement token while affected by Appraising Glare.

For example, if a unit of Boyz is being led by a Warboss and a Weirdboy, and has two Judgement tokens, after the Boyz unit is destroyed, the Warboss and the Weirdboy each become individual units, each with two Judgement tokens.

# Q: Can I gain CP from another source, such as by discarding a Secondary Mission card, in the same turn in which I gained 3CP from the Ruthless Efficiency Detachment rule (since it ignores the cap on the number of CP you can gain during a battle round)?
