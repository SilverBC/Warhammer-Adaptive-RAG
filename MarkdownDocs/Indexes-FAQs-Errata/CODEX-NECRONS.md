These documents collect amendments to the rules and present our responses to players’ frequently asked questions. Often these amendments are updates necessitated by new releases or community feedback. At other times, these amendments are errata designed to correct mistakes or add clarity to a rule that is not as clear as it might be. Where existing passages of rules text are presented, new or revised sections are marked in red. Entries marked with have been newly added or revised since the previous iteration of this document.

# FAQS

# Q: If a unit is not wholly within 6" of one battlefield edge, is that unit eligible to shoot in my Shooting phase?

A: Yes.

# Q: Does the Canoptek Court Autodivinator Enhancement trigger when army rule effects such as Code Chivalric (Imperial Knights) award a player CP, or when an opponent discards a Secondary Mission card for 1CP?

A: No in both cases. It only triggers when your opponent gains CP as the result of an ability (not any other kind of rule).

# Q: If a unit is removed from the battlefield using the Hypercrypt Legion Hyperphasing Detachment rule and it has the Deep Strike ability, can that unit arrive from Reserves in the first battle round?

A: Yes, provided you are going second.

# Q: If I target a Canoptek Wraiths unit with the Canoptek Court Reactive Subroutines Stratagem, can this trigger that unit’s Wraith Form ability?

A: Yes.

# Page 88 – The Silent King, Keywords

Change to read: ‘ – ALL MODELS: Vehicle, Epic Hero – SZAREKH MODEL: Character, The Silent King’

# Page 115 – Night Scythe, Abilities, Core

Add ‘Deep Strike’.

# Q: Can I use the Cosmic Precision Stratagem to set up a unit anywhere on the battlefield instead of only wholly within 6" of a battlefield edge, even if it doesn’t have the Deep Strike ability?

A: Yes.

# Q: When being set up using the Cosmic Precision Stratagem, does a model that is large (e.g. a Tesseract Vault) have to follow the rules for large models in the Deploying Units section of the Rules Commentary?

A: No.

# Q: Do rules that activate Reanimation Protocols (e.g. the Protocol of the Undying Legions Stratagem) only apply to a Bodyguard unit whose attached Leader unit is on the battlefield if one or more models from that Bodyguard unit are also still on the battlefield?

A: Yes.

# Q: Can I use the Monolith’s Eternity Gate ability in the first battle round to reposition a unit that is on the battlefield?

A: Yes, provided the mission rules you are using do not state otherwise. If you are using the Leviathan or Pariah Nexus mission packs, for example, the answer is no.

# Q: Can I use the Monolith’s Eternity Gate ability in the first battle round to set up a unit that I removed from the battlefield and placed into Strategic Reserves using the Hyperphasing Detachment rule?

A: Yes, including if you are using the Leviathan or Pariah Nexus mission packs, for example.

# Q: When using the Protocol of the Conquering Tyrant Stratagem or Lokhust Destroyers’ Hard-wired for Destruction ability, to be eligible to re-roll the Hit roll, does the unit also need to be eligible to re-roll a Hit roll of 1?

A: Yes (see ‘Rules with Multiple Conditions and Effects’ in the Rules Commentary).

# Q: When I set up a unit using the Monolith’s Eternity Gate ability, do I have to set that unit up wholly within 6" of one battlefield edge?

A: No.
