# IMPERIAL KNIGHTS

# ARMY RULES

Imperial Knights fight by a stringent set of codes to ensure that in addition to defeating the enemy, honour is always upheld.

# CODE CHIVALRIC

If your Army Faction is Imperial Knights, at the end of the Read Mission Objectives step, you must select one of the Oaths below to be active for your army. Models from your army with this ability gain the associated Oath ability, and you gain the associated Deed to complete.

If, at the start of any of your Command phases, your selected Oath’s Deed is completed, your army becomes Honoured for the rest of the battle and you gain 3CP (you can only gain CP in this way once per battle, and CP gained in this way are an exemption to the Core Rules that limit the maximum number of CP you can gain per battle round to 1).

# LAY LOW THE TYRANT

- Oath Ability: Each time this model is selected to shoot or fight, you can re-roll one Hit roll and you can re-roll one Wound roll.
- Deed: This deed is completed if the enemy Warlord is destroyed.

# RECLAIM THE REALM

- Oath Ability: Add 1" to this model’s Move characteristic and add 1 to Advance and Charge rolls made for this model.
- Deed: This deed is completed if you control one or more objective markers in your opponent’s deployment zone.

# BONDSMAN ABILITIES

Some Questoris models have a Bondsman ability, tagged with the word ‘Bondsman’. In your Command phase, one or more models from your army with a Bondsman ability can use that ability. For each one that does, select one friendly Armiger model within 12" of that model (you cannot select an Armiger model that is already being affected by a Bondsman ability). Until the start of your next Command phase, the Armiger model you selected is affected by that Bondsman ability.

# SUPER-HEAVY WALKER

Each time a model with this ability makes a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move, it can move through models (excluding Titanic models) and sections of terrain features that are 4" or less in height. When doing so:

- It can move within Engagement Range of enemy models, but cannot end that move within Engagement Range of them.
- It can also move through sections of terrain features that are more than 4" in height, but if it does, after it has moved, roll one D6: on a 1, that model is Battle-shocked.

# FREEBLADES

Freeblades often wander the galaxy, aiding the armies of the Imperium.

If every model in your army has the Imperium keyword, you can include either 1 Titanic Imperial Knights model or up to 3 Armiger models in your army, even if they do not have the Faction keyword you selected in the Select Army Faction step. None of these models can be your Warlord, and they cannot be given Enhancements.

Balance Dataslate June 2024# Warhammer 40K - Imperial Knights Noble Lance

# IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE

# DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Imperial Knights, you can use this Noble Lance Detachment rule.

# INDOMITABLE HEROES

Gathered into a powerful formation known as a lance, Imperial Knights and the Nobles who pilot them wage their honour-driven assaults with renowned resilience and bloody-minded determination.

All Imperial Knights models from your army have the Feel No Pain 6+ ability. If your army is Honoured, those models have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability.

# IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE

# ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Noble Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Noble Lance Enhancements.

# REVERED KNIGHT (AURA)

Never hesitating before tyrannical invaders, this Knight is beheld as the very epitome of honour – a monolithic incarnation of the Imperium. While they stand, courage is inviolate and victory is assured.

# MYTHIC HERO

This warrior is a legendary figure who embodies the Code Chivalric, and tales of their deeds have spread far and wide. To be a Bondsman to such a warrior is a great honour indeed.

- Imperial Knights model only. While a friendly Imperial Knights model is within 6" of the bearer, improve that model’s Leadership characteristic by 1. If your army is Honoured, increase the range of this Aura ability to 12".

# MYSTERIOUS GUARDIAN

Manifesting as though from nowhere, this Noble’s titanic steed is an elemental force of vengeance against the Emperor of Mankind’s foes. At battle’s end, it disappears as mysteriously as it arrived.

- Imperial Knights model only. The bearer has the Deep Strike ability. Once per battle, at the end of your opponent’s turn, if the bearer is not within Engagement Range of any enemy units, it can fade away. If it does, remove it from the battlefield then, in the Reinforcements step of your subsequent Movement phase, set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models. If the battle ends and the bearer is not on the battlefield, it is destroyed.

# BANNER OF MACHARIUS TRIUMPHANT

A gift from Lord Solar Macharius himself to honour the noble houses that accompanied his crusade, legend has it that this banner has never seen defeat: every time a Knight has carried it to war, a great victory has been won.

- Imperial Knights model only. If you control an objective marker at the end of your Command phase and the bearer is within range of that objective marker, that objective marker remains under your control even if you have no models within range of it, until your opponent controls it at the start or end of any turn.

# UNYIELDING PARAGON

This Knight is an unyielding army unto themselves, capable of engaging entire enemy forces and holding their ground, emerging through the fiercest firestorms bloodied, but unbowed.

- Questoris model only. Each time an attack is allocated to the bearer, worsen the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

|TROPHY CLAIM|VALIANT LAST STAND|
|---|---|
|NOBLE LANCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM Once a mighty foe is laid low, the victorious Knight’s emitters blare its triumph, announcing the glory brought to the Imperium, but shame awaits those who fail in such confrontations. 2CP WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase. TARGET: One Imperial Knights model from your army that has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase, and one enemy Monster or Vehicle unit. EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time your model makes an attack that targets that enemy unit, add 1 to the Wound roll. If your model destroys that enemy unit this phase, you gain 1CP, but if your model does not destroy that enemy unit this phase, you cannot use this Stratagem again for the rest of the battle.|NOBLE LANCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM Badly wounded, their Knight’s generator on the verge of overload, still the Noble fights on, drawing upon their reserves of chivalric heroism to sell their life as dearly as they can. 2CP WHEN: Fight phase. TARGET: One Imperial Knights model from your army that was just destroyed and that is eligible to fight but has not been selected to fight this phase. You can use this Stratagem on that model even though it was just destroyed. EFFECT: Before rolling to see if this model deals any mortal wounds as a result of its Deadly Demise ability, it can fight; when doing so, it is assumed to have 1 wound remaining, or all its wounds remaining if your army is Honoured. After it has finished resolving its attacks, resolve its Deadly Demise ability as normal. RESTRICTIONS: You cannot target Sir Hekhtur with this Stratagem.|
