# DEATHWATCH

# ARMY RULES

From their hidden bases in orbiting watch fortresses, the Deathwatch dispatch carefully selected operatives to hunt down and exterminate alien presences wherever they may be found. Each of these post-human warriors is a veteran of countless battles, tithed by their original Chapter to undertake the Long Vigil and guard against alien incursion.

# KILL TEAMS

When faced with an array of missions to complete and varying enemies to lay low, the Deathwatch are highly adept at forming effective kill teams that mesh starkly diverse armour and equipment.

Each time an attack targets a Kill Team unit from your army that contains models with different Toughness characteristics, until the attacking unit has finished making its attacks, use the Toughness characteristic of the majority of the models in that unit when determining what roll is required for that attack to successfully wound. If two or more Toughness characteristics are tied for majority, use the highest value.

For the purposes of determining which models can embark within a Transport model, Kill Team Terminator models, Kill Team Outrider models, Kill Team Biker models and models equipped with a jump pack each take up the space of 2 models, but can otherwise embark within any Transport their unit can embark within, even though similar models in other units may have the Terminator, Mounted or Jump Pack keywords.

For the purposes of interacting with terrain features, all models in units with the Kill Team ability are treated as Infantry, even though similar models in other units may have the Mounted or Jump Pack keywords.

Designer’s Note: While the slight abstractions in the above rules cause some models to behave differently to similar models in other units, they are designed to minimise unusual or complicated movement, Transport and Benefit of Cover effects.

# DEATHWATCH – BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE

# DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can use this Black Spear Task Force Detachment rule.

# RESTRICTIONS

- Your army can include Deathwatch units, but it cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn from any other Chapter.
- Your army cannot include any of the following units:
- Assault Squad
- Assault Squad with Jump Packs
- Attack Bike Squad
- Devastator Squad
- Land Speeder Storm
- Scout Squad
- Scout Sniper Squad
- Tactical Squad

# MISSION TACTICS

Thousands of years of collated strategic data and hard-won combat experience have provided the Deathwatch with the ultimate battlefield tactics to combat almost any foe.

At the start of your Command phase, you can select one of the Mission Tactics listed below. Until the start of your next Command phase, that Mission Tactic is active and its effects apply to all units from your army with this ability. Each Mission Tactic can only be selected once per battle.

# FUROR TACTICS

When the enemy horde grows close, the Deathwatch will be tasked with the decimation of their core. Aiming not for clinical kills but for maximum destruction over a wide area, they tear the heart from the enemy army.

While this Mission Tactic is active, weapons equipped by Adeptus Astartes units from your army have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

# MALLEUS TACTICS

When the giants of war lumber forth, the Deathwatch will adopt Malleus tactics. Even the largest behemoth has a weak point, and the archives of the Deathwatch number them all.

While this Mission Tactic is active, weapons equipped by Adeptus Astartes units from your army have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.

# PURGATUS TACTICS

By adopting Purgatus tactics, the Deathwatch focus their deadly ire upon the commanders of the enemy host, assassinating them one after another with pitiless head shots and killing thrusts of the blade.

While this Mission Tactic is active, each time an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army makes an attack, if a Critical Hit is scored, that attack has the [PRECISION] ability.

# DEATHWATCH – BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE

# STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Black Spear Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Black Spear Task Force Stratagems.

# ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT

# BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The belligerency and transhuman physiologies of the Adeptus Astartes make them unyielding foes.

- WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.
- TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, worsen the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

# TELEPORTARIUM

# BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Site-to-site battlefield teleportation is a rare capability indeed, used only by the Deathwatch in extreme situations.

- WHEN: End of your opponent’s Fight phase.
- TARGET: Up to two Kill Team units from your army, or one other Adeptus Astartes Infantry unit from your army.
- EFFECT: Remove those units from the battlefield. In the Reinforcements step of your next Movement phase, set each of those units up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models.
- RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select any units that are within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.

# ADAPTIVE TACTICS

# BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Only a truly versatile approach to warfare allows the tactical genius of the Deathwatch to best the myriad xenos foes they face.

- WHEN: Your Command phase.
- TARGET: Up to two Kill Team units from your army, or one other Adeptus Astartes unit from your army.
- EFFECT: For each unit targeted, select the Furor Tactics, Malleus Tactics or Purgatus Tactics. Until the start of your next Command phase, that Mission Tactic is active for that unit instead of any Mission Tactic that is active for your army.

# HELLFIRE ROUNDS

# BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE – WARGEAR STRATAGEM

Hellfire rounds douse their targets in voracious acids that are utterly lethal to organic life.

- WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
- TARGET: Up to two Kill Team units from your army that have not been selected to shoot this phase, or one other Adeptus Astartes unit from your army (excluding Vehicles) that has not been selected to shoot this phase.
- EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, bolt weapons* (excluding Devastating Wounds weapons) equipped by models in your unit have the [ANTI-INFANTRY 2+] and [ANTI-MONSTER 5+] abilities.
- RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select any units that have already been targeted with either the Kraken Rounds or Dragonfire Rounds Stratagems this phase.

# DEATHWATCH – BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE

# ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Black Spear Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Black Spear Task Force Enhancements.

# THIEF OF SECRETS

The Thief of Secrets is a blade whose machine spirit has an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. It has tasted the vitae of countless alien races, absorbing those liquids through auto-sanctified sanguinator-channels and codifying them through the honeycombed array of logicum cells within. The biological secrets of many xenos races have thus been laid bare, allowing the blade’s user to modulate its power field, the better to slice through chitinous armour, rupture xenoform organs and burn out alien nervous systems.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Improve the Strength, Damage and Armour Penetration characteristics of the bearer’s melee weapons by 1. If an enemy model is destroyed as the result of a melee attack made by the bearer, at the end of that phase, until the end of the battle, improve the Strength, Damage and Armour Penetration characteristics of the bearer’s melee weapons by 2 instead.

# OSSEUS KEY

The ancient clavis known as the Osseus Key is said to be the most powerful of its kind. Where other such devices are made from sanctified platinum, the Osseus Key is made from the hand and finger bones of deceased Imperial Fists heroes that fought in the Horus Heresy, scrimshawed with inhuman care and imbued with the fiercest machine spirits of the age. No portal can bar its bearer from entry, and no xenos machine can stand before his wrath.

# BEACON ANGELIS

The Beacon Angelis was devised to guide the Deathwatch to the threshold of the alien adversary. Housed within a reliquary, it calls out to the warriors’ augur arrays with the voices of a hundred electric cherubim, its summons so strong that it draws the righteous unto its locale regardless of what darkness may surround it.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Models in the bearer’s unit have the Deep Strike ability. In addition, you can target the bearer’s unit with the Rapid Ingress Stratagem for 0CP.

# THE TOME OF ECTOCLADES

This grimoire, bound in the skin of the alien, holds the most powerful truths the Deathwatch have uncovered about their foes, whether xenos or those who harbour them. On occasion, such knowledge has been known to save not only the book’s custodian, but entire worlds.

Watch Master or Captain model only. Once per battle, after you have selected an enemy unit using the Oath of Moment ability in your Command phase, the bearer can use this Enhancement if they are on the battlefield. When they do, select a second enemy unit – until the start of your next Command phase, each time an Adeptus Astartes model from your army makes an attack that targets either of those enemy units, you can re-roll the Hit roll and you can re-roll the Wound roll.

Watch Master or Techmarine model only. At the start of your opponent’s Shooting phase, select one enemy Vehicle unit (excluding Titanic units) within 12" of and visible to the bearer. That model must take a Leadership test. If that test is passed, until the end of the phase, each time a model in that unit makes an attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll; if that test is failed, that unit is not eligible to shoot this phase.
